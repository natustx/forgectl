# Forgectl

Forgectl is a spec driven development harness. Takes plan to implementation completeness.
Specs are the source of truth, the new form of code.   Agents take diffs in the specs and generate code from it, just like compilers take C or Golang code and generate assembly.
Forgectl is a compiler of specs into executable code, built for Agents.


## Workflow

Take a plan and pipe it into your LLM coding agent.
The agent will then 
1. crete/update specs according to the changes in the plan
2. create a implementation plan
3. create implementation from the plan


## Pipelines

- Specify - take a plan and align specs to the plan
- Implemenation Planning - Plan how to implement the changes in specs to the existing code base.
- Implement - take an implementation plan, and implement it.


## Future Work

- Reverse Engineer implemenation into Specs for brownfield development repos
- Front End Implementation Agents
  - using playwright agents
- Currently Eval agents are general_purpose, so create  multiple eval agents for their specific tasks


## Skills
### Planner

Use the Planner Skill to plan, this allows you to currently create plans that will shape your specs.
It will help you tailor plans that have less defects and more accurate and solid logic.
- used to table ideas in the `tabled` section of the workspace

### Implement From Specs

If you updated the specs already, just use this to make a quick implementation.   The idea here is you want to make a quick implementation update, after changing the specs.

### Specs

Use this when you want to
1. update the specs
2. have a plan and want to embed into the specifications
3. want to refactor your specifications

### Implementation Planning

Used to view the diff in specs and generate a plan of implementation. Add your own references and agents to help out with creating notes on implementation details for particular parts of the specs that need to be implemented.
This pipeline of the process is involved with generating a plan to implement.

### Implement

Take a implementation plan, and implement it. Simple as that.  This is where your agent is on auto pilot, and reinforces the spec generation into the codebase.
