# Forgectl
Forgectl is a spec driven development harness. Takes plan to implementation completeness.


## Workflow
Take a plan and pipe it into your LLM coding agent.
The agent will then 
1. crete/update specs according to the changes in the plan
2. create a implementation plan
3. create implementation from the plan


## Pipelines
- Specify - take a plan and align specs to the plan
- Implemenation Planning - Plan how to implement the changes in specs to the existing code base.
- Implement - take an implementation plan, and implement it.


## Future Work
- Reverse Engineer implemenation into Specs for brownfield development repos
- Front End Implementation Agents
  - using playwright agents
- Currently Eval agents are general_purpose, so create  multiple eval agents for their specific tasks


## Skills
### Planner

Use the Planner Skill to plan, this allows you to currently create plans that will shape your specs.
It will help you tailor plans that have less defects and more accurate and solid logic.
- used to table ideas in the `tabled` section of the workspace

### Implement From Specs

If you updated the specs already, just use this to make a quick implementation.   The idea here is you want to make a quick implementation update, after changing the specs.
