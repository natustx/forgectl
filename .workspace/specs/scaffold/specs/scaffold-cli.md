# Scaffold CLI

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold CLI manages spec generation lifecycle state through a JSON-backed state machine with validated input and deterministic transitions.

## Context

The spec generation process involves multiple states (orient, select, draft, evaluate, refine, review, accept) applied to a queue of specifications. Without persistent state, an architect loses track of progress across sessions. The scaffold is a Go CLI tool (built with Cobra) that reads and writes a single JSON state file, enforcing valid transitions and providing the architect with unambiguous next-step guidance.

The scaffold tracks evaluation history — deficiencies found, fixes applied, and verdicts — creating an audit trail from draft to acceptance.

## Depends On
- None. The scaffold is a standalone tool with no runtime dependencies on other project components.

## Integration Points

| Component | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| Spec generation skill | The skill document describes the process; the scaffold enforces the state machine that drives it |
| Evaluation sub-agent | The EVALUATE state is where the architect spawns a sub-agent; the scaffold tracks round count, verdict, deficiencies, and fixes |
| Queue input file | The architect generates a JSON file conforming to the queue schema; the scaffold validates and ingests it during init |
| Eval output directory | The eval sub-agent writes structured output to `<project>/specs/.eval/`; the scaffold does not read these files but the convention is documented |

---

## Interface

### Inputs

#### Queue Input File (provided via `--from` on `init`)

A JSON file conforming to this schema:

```json
{
  "specs": [
    {
      "name": "Repository Loading",
      "domain": "optimizer",
      "topic": "The optimizer clones or locates a repository and provides its path for downstream modules",
      "file": "optimizer/specs/repository-loading.md",
      "planning_sources": [
        ".workspace/planning/optimizer/repo-snapshot-loading.md"
      ],
      "depends_on": []
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `specs` | array | yes | Ordered list of specs to generate |
| `specs[].name` | string | yes | Display name for the spec (used in status output) |
| `specs[].domain` | string | yes | Domain grouping (e.g., "optimizer", "api", "web-portal", "protocols") |
| `specs[].topic` | string | yes | One-sentence topic of concern |
| `specs[].file` | string | yes | Target file path relative to project root |
| `specs[].planning_sources` | string[] | yes | Planning document paths the spec is derived from; may be empty array |
| `specs[].depends_on` | string[] | yes | Names of specs this one depends on; may be empty array |

No additional fields are permitted.

#### CLI Arguments

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `init` | `--min-rounds N` (default 1), `--max-rounds N` (required), `--from <path>` (required), `--user-guided` (optional, default false) | Initialize state file from a validated queue |
| `next` | none | Print the current state and what the architect does now |
| `advance` | `--file <path>` (optional, DRAFT only), `--verdict PASS\|FAIL` (EVALUATE or REVIEW), `--message <text>` (required with PASS in EVALUATE), `--deficiencies <csv>` (with FAIL in EVALUATE), `--fixed <text>` (in REFINE) | Transition from current state to next |
| `status` | none | Print full session state: current spec, eval history, queue, completed |
| `add-commit` | `--id N` (required), `--hash <hash>` (required) | Add a commit hash to a specific completed spec. Hash is validated against git. Duplicates are rejected. |
| `reconcile-commit` | `--hash <hash>` (required) | Auto-register a commit to all completed specs whose files were touched. Runs `git show --name-only` to match files. Hash validated. Deduplicates. |

### Outputs

All output is to stdout. The scaffold writes state changes to `scaffold-state.json`.

#### `next` output

Prints a structured block:

```
State:   REFINE
ID:      3
Spec:    Repository Loading
Domain:  optimizer
File:    optimizer/specs/repository-loading.md
Round:   1/3
Deficiencies: [Completeness, Format Compliance]
Action:  Address deficiencies from evaluation. Edit the spec file. Advance with --fixed <description>.
```

#### `status` output

Prints session config, current spec with eval history, queue grouped by domain, and completed specs with eval trail.

#### `init` validation output (on failure)

When the input file fails validation, the scaffold prints:
1. Each validation error (missing field, extra field, wrong type) with the path to the offending location.
2. The complete valid schema as a reference.

The scaffold exits with a non-zero code on validation failure.

### Rejection

| Condition | Signal | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `init` called when `scaffold-state.json` already exists | Error: "State file already exists. Delete it to reinitialize." Exit code 1. | Prevents accidental loss of in-progress state |
| `--from` file fails schema validation | Error listing violations. Prints full valid schema. Exit code 1. | Architect needs to see what's wrong |
| `--min-rounds` exceeds `--max-rounds` | Error: "--min-rounds cannot exceed --max-rounds." Exit code 1. | Invalid configuration |
| `advance` called with `--file` outside of DRAFT state | Error naming the current state. Exit code 1. | Flag is meaningless outside DRAFT |
| `advance` called with `--verdict` outside of EVALUATE or REVIEW | Error naming the current state. Exit code 1. | Verdict is only valid in these states |
| `advance` called in EVALUATE without `--verdict` | Error. Exit code 1. | Verdict determines the transition |
| `advance` called with `--verdict PASS` in EVALUATE without `--message` | Error. Exit code 1. | Accepted specs must be committed |
| `next` or `advance` called before `init` | Error. Exit code 1. | State file must exist |
| `add-commit` or `reconcile-commit` with a hash that does not exist in git | Error: "commit does not exist in the repository." Exit code 1. | Prevents registering invalid hashes |
| `add-commit` with a hash already registered to the target spec | Error: "commit already registered." Exit code 1. | Prevents duplicates |
| `add-commit` targeting an active (not completed) spec | Error: "spec is still active." Exit code 1. | Commits are registered to completed specs only |

---

## Behavior

### Commit Hash Validation

All commands that accept a commit hash (`add-commit`, `reconcile-commit`, and the auto-commit in `advance --verdict PASS`) validate that the hash exists in git using `git cat-file -t`. The object type must be `commit`. Non-existent hashes, tags, blobs, and tree objects are rejected.

### Registering Commits to Specs

#### add-commit
Appends a commit hash to a specific completed spec by ID. The hash is validated against git and checked for duplicates before appending.

#### reconcile-commit
Runs `git show --name-only <hash>` to determine which files were changed, then matches file paths against `completed[].file`. The hash is appended to every matching spec that doesn't already have it. Reports which specs were updated.

---

## Session Archiving

Completed session state files are archived to a permanent directory:

```
.workspace/specs/scaffold/sessions/
├── optimizer-2026-03-15.json
├── api-2026-03-17.json
└── ...
```

- The active `scaffold-state.json` is gitignored (ephemeral working state).
- Archived sessions in `sessions/` are committed to git (permanent audit trail).
- Naming convention: `<domain>-<date>.json`.
- Archive before starting a new session. The active state file must be deleted (or the scaffold will reject `init`).

---

## Behavior

### Initializing a Session

#### Preconditions
- No `scaffold-state.json` exists.
- `--from`, `--max-rounds` are provided.
- `--min-rounds` <= `--max-rounds`.

#### Steps
1. Read and parse the file at `--from`.
2. Validate against the queue schema (same rules as before).
3. If validation fails: print errors and schema, exit code 1.
4. If validation passes: create `scaffold-state.json` with state ORIENT.

#### Postconditions
- State file exists with `min_rounds`, `max_rounds`, `user_guided` set, queue populated, completed empty.

#### Error Handling
- File not found, invalid JSON, schema failure: same as before.

---

### Advancing State

#### Preconditions
- `scaffold-state.json` exists.

#### Steps

| From State | Condition | To State | Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| ORIENT | always | SELECT | Pull next from queue into `current_spec` |
| SELECT | always | DRAFT | — |
| DRAFT | always | EVALUATE | If `--file` provided, override file path. Set round to 1. |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS` | ACCEPT | Record eval (PASS). Auto-commit with `--message`. |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict FAIL`, round < `min_rounds` | REFINE | Record eval (FAIL + deficiencies). Auto-refine. |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict FAIL`, round >= `min_rounds` | REVIEW | Record eval (FAIL + deficiencies). Human decides. |
| REFINE | always | EVALUATE | Record `--fixed` on last eval. Increment round. |
| REVIEW | no verdict or `--verdict PASS` | ACCEPT | User accepts. |
| REVIEW | `--verdict FAIL` | REFINE | User grants extra round. |
| ACCEPT | queue non-empty | ORIENT | Move spec to completed (with eval history + commit hash). |
| ACCEPT | queue empty | DONE | Move spec to completed. |

#### Postconditions
- State file reflects the new state.
- Eval records accumulate on `current_spec.evals` and carry to `completed[].evals`.

#### Error Handling
- Invalid flags for state: specific error per state.
- Invalid verdict value: error.

---

### Eval Output Convention

The evaluation sub-agent writes structured markdown to a known directory:

```
<project>/specs/.eval/
├── <spec-name>-r1.md
├── <spec-name>-r2.md
└── ...
```

The scaffold does not read or write these files. This is a convention for the architect and sub-agent. The file name includes the spec name (kebab-case) and round number. Each file contains the sub-agent's full evaluation output.

---

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--min-rounds` | integer | 1 | Minimum evaluation rounds before REVIEW |
| `--max-rounds` | integer | none (required) | Maximum evaluation rounds per spec |
| `--user-guided` | boolean | false | When set, SELECT state pauses for user discussion |
| `--from` | string | none (required on init) | Path to queue input JSON file |

| Field | Type | Description |

| `min_rounds` | integer | Minimum eval rounds before REVIEW |
| `max_rounds` | integer | Maximum eval rounds per spec |

| `current_spec.evals[].verdict` | string | PASS or FAIL |
| `current_spec.evals[].deficiencies` | string[] | Failed dimension names (on FAIL) |
| `current_spec.evals[].fixed` | string | What was fixed after this eval (populated during REFINE) |
| `completed[].evals` | array | Full eval history carried from current_spec |

---

## Invariants

1. **Single active spec.** At most one spec is in `current_spec` at any time.
2. **Round monotonicity.** The round counter only increments.
3. **Min/max round bounds.** FAIL below `min_rounds` auto-refines. FAIL at or above `min_rounds` goes to REVIEW. REVIEW can grant rounds beyond `max_rounds`.
4. **Queue order preserved.** Specs are pulled from the front of the queue.
5. **State file is the only mutable artifact.** The queue input file is read once at init.
6. **No implicit state.** All information for transitions is in the state file.
7. **Eval history is append-only.** Eval records accumulate and are never deleted or modified (except `fixed` is set during REFINE).

---

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round < `min_rounds`.
  - **Expected behavior:** Transition to REFINE (auto-refine, no REVIEW).
  - **Rationale:** Below minimum rounds, the architect must try to fix before escalating.

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round >= `min_rounds` and <= `max_rounds`.
  - **Expected behavior:** Transition to REVIEW.
  - **Rationale:** Past minimum, the human decides whether to accept or grant another round.

- **Scenario:** REVIEW grants extra round beyond `max_rounds`.
  - **Expected behavior:** REFINE → EVALUATE proceeds. The round counter increments past `max_rounds`.
  - **Rationale:** `max_rounds` controls auto-behavior. The human can override.

- **Scenario:** REVIEW with `--verdict PASS`.
  - **Expected behavior:** Transition to ACCEPT.
  - **Rationale:** Explicit acceptance from REVIEW.

- **Scenario:** REVIEW with no verdict.
  - **Expected behavior:** Transition to ACCEPT (default accept).
  - **Rationale:** Advancing from REVIEW without a verdict means the human reviewed and accepted.

- **Scenario:** Eval has no deficiencies recorded.
  - **Expected behavior:** The `deficiencies` field is an empty array or null. REFINE still works — the architect addresses issues without scaffold-tracked deficiencies.
  - **Rationale:** The `--deficiencies` flag is optional. Not all evaluations may produce structured deficiency names.

---

## Reconciliation Phase

After all individual specs are completed (DONE), the scaffold enters a reconciliation phase that cross-validates dependencies and integration points across all specs.

### State Flow

```
DONE → RECONCILE → RECONCILE_EVAL → RECONCILE_REVIEW → COMPLETE
                        ↑                    │
                        └────────────────────┘ (another pass)
```

### States

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| DONE | All individual specs complete. Advance to begin reconciliation. |
| RECONCILE | Architect fixes cross-references across all specs: verifies Depends On entries have corresponding Integration Points, verifies symmetry (if A mentions B, B mentions A), fixes naming consistency. Architect stages all changed files with `git add`. Advance when ready. |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | Architect tells the sub-agent to run `git diff --staged` to see all reconciliation changes in a single view. Sub-agent evaluates consistency across all specs. Record `--verdict`. |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | Eval returned FAIL. Human decides: accept (`advance`) or fix and re-evaluate (`advance --verdict FAIL --fixed <description>`). |
| COMPLETE | Session fully complete. All specs reconciled. |

### Reconcile Evaluation Sub-Agent

The reconciliation eval differs from per-spec evals. The sub-agent:
1. Runs `git diff --staged` to see all changes
2. Reads all completed spec files
3. Checks:
   - Every `Depends On` reference points to a spec that exists
   - Every dependency has a corresponding `Integration Points` entry in the target spec
   - Integration Points are symmetric (if A lists B, B lists A)
   - Spec names are consistent across all references
   - No circular dependencies exist

### Transition Table Additions

| From State | Condition | To State | Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| DONE | always | RECONCILE | Initialize `reconcile` state with round 0 |
| RECONCILE | always | RECONCILE_EVAL | Increment reconcile round |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS` | COMPLETE | Record eval |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict FAIL` | RECONCILE_REVIEW | Record eval with deficiencies |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | no verdict or `--verdict PASS` | COMPLETE | Accept |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | `--verdict FAIL` | RECONCILE | Grant another pass, record `--fixed` |
| COMPLETE | — | Error: nothing to advance | Terminal |

### State File Additions

```json
{
  "reconcile": {
    "round": 2,
    "evals": [
      { "round": 1, "verdict": "FAIL", "deficiencies": ["Missing reverse references"], "fixed": "Added reverse refs to all specs" },
      { "round": 2, "verdict": "PASS" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Testing Criteria (Reconciliation)

#### Reconcile flow PASS
- **Given:** All specs complete (DONE state)
- **When:** DONE → RECONCILE → RECONCILE_EVAL with `--verdict PASS`
- **Then:** State is COMPLETE.

#### Reconcile flow FAIL then fix
- **Given:** RECONCILE_EVAL returns FAIL
- **When:** RECONCILE_REVIEW grants another round → RECONCILE → RECONCILE_EVAL with PASS
- **Then:** State is COMPLETE. Two eval records.

#### Reconcile review accept without fix
- **Given:** RECONCILE_EVAL returns FAIL, state is RECONCILE_REVIEW
- **When:** `advance` (no verdict)
- **Then:** State is COMPLETE.

#### COMPLETE cannot advance
- **Given:** State is COMPLETE
- **When:** `advance` is called
- **Then:** Error: "session complete."

#### RECONCILE_EVAL requires verdict
- **Given:** State is RECONCILE_EVAL
- **When:** `advance` without `--verdict`
- **Then:** Error.
