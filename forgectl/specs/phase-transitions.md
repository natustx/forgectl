# Phase Transitions

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold enforces explicit context-refresh checkpoints between lifecycle phases.

## Context

The forgectl scaffold is a Go CLI tool (built with Cobra) that manages the full software development lifecycle through four sequential phases — specifying, generate_planning_queue, planning, and implementing — backed by a single JSON state file (`forgectl-state.json`). State names (ORIENT, EVALUATE, etc.) are reused across phases with phase-specific behavior; the `phase` field determines which states are valid and how they behave.

Between phases, a PHASE_SHIFT state acts as a hard stop — the user is told to refresh their context before proceeding. This prevents stale context from carrying over between fundamentally different activities. PHASE_SHIFT also fires at domain boundaries within the same phase, because switching domains means switching codebases.

The `planning.plan_all_before_implementing` config (default `false`) controls how domains are processed:
- **`false` (default, interleaved):** Each domain is planned and then immediately implemented before the next domain begins. The flow cycles: planning → implementing → planning → implementing.
- **`true` (all planning first):** All domains are planned first, then all domains are implemented. PHASE_SHIFT fires between domains within each phase.

The generate_planning_queue phase auto-generates a plan queue from completed specs and gives the architect an opportunity to review, reorder, and edit it before planning begins. It has three states: ORIENT (generates the file), REFINE (architect reviews/edits), and PHASE_SHIFT (validates and transitions to planning).

The scaffold can be initialized at specifying, planning, or implementing — allowing users to skip earlier phases when inputs already exist. The generate_planning_queue phase cannot be initialized directly; it requires a completed specifying phase.

## Depends On
- **spec-reconciliation** — COMPLETE triggers the specifying→generate_planning_queue phase shift.
- **plan-production** — ACCEPT or DONE triggers planning→implementing phase shift (depending on `plan_all_before_implementing`).
- **batch-implementation** — DONE triggers implementing→planning phase shift when `plan_all_before_implementing: false` and plans remain.
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| spec-reconciliation | COMPLETE → PHASE_SHIFT (specifying → generate_planning_queue) |
| plan-production | Receives the plans queue when generate_planning_queue→planning advances; ACCEPT → PHASE_SHIFT (planning → implementing) when `plan_all_before_implementing: false`; DONE → PHASE_SHIFT when `true` |
| batch-implementation | Receives validated plan.json when planning→implementing advances; DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → planning) when `plan_all_before_implementing: false` and plans remain; DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → implementing) when `true` and plans remain |
| session-init | Plan queue schema (same validation) reused at generate_planning_queue→planning shift |

## Interface

### Inputs

#### `advance` flags at PHASE_SHIFT

| Phase Shift | Flags |
|-------------|-------|
| specifying → generate_planning_queue | `--from <path>` (optional). If provided, skips generate_planning_queue entirely and transitions directly to planning ORIENT. |
| generate_planning_queue → planning | `--from <path>` (optional). If provided, uses the override file instead of the auto-generated `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`. |
| planning → implementing | (no additional flags) |
| planning → planning (domain boundary) | (no additional flags) |
| implementing → planning | (no additional flags) |
| implementing → implementing (domain boundary) | (no additional flags) |

The `--guided` / `--no-guided` flags are accepted at phase shifts and update `config.general.user_guided` before the transition proceeds.

#### `advance` flags at generate_planning_queue states

| State | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| ORIENT | (no flags) |
| REFINE | (no flags) |

---

## Behavior

### Specifying → Generate Planning Queue

#### Entering PHASE_SHIFT
When the architect advances from COMPLETE (spec-reconciliation), the scaffold transitions to PHASE_SHIFT. No work is done — the scaffold prints the phase shift message and waits.

#### Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT

**Without `--from`:**

1. Set `phase` to `"generate_planning_queue"`.
2. Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
3. Auto-generate the plan queue (see Generate Planning Queue phase below).
4. Print the ORIENT output.

**With `--from` (skip generation):**

1. Read and validate the plan queue at `--from`.
2. If validation fails: print errors. State remains PHASE_SHIFT.
3. If validation passes:
   - Populate the plans queue in state.
   - Set `phase` to `"planning"`.
   - Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
   - Pull first plan from queue.
   - Print the planning ORIENT action description.

### Generate Planning Queue

A three-state phase between specifying and planning. The scaffold auto-generates a plan queue from completed specs, writes it to a file, and gives the architect an opportunity to review and reorder before planning begins.

#### ORIENT

On entry, the scaffold:

1. Group completed specs by domain (order determined by the spec queue — the order domains first appeared).
2. For each domain, produce a plan entry:
   - `name`: `"<Domain> Implementation Plan"` (domain name capitalized).
   - `domain`: the domain name.
   - `file`: `<domain>/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/plan.json`.
   - `specs`: all completed spec file paths for this domain.
   - `spec_commits`: deduplicated list of all `commit_hashes` from the domain's completed specs.
   - `code_search_roots`: from `specifying.domains[<domain>].code_search_roots` if set via `set-roots`, otherwise `["<domain>/"]`.
3. Write the plan queue to `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`.
4. Print the ORIENT output.

Advancing from ORIENT transitions to REFINE.

#### REFINE

The architect reviews `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`, reorders domains, adjusts entries, or leaves it unchanged.

Advancing from REFINE:

1. Read `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`.
2. Validate the plan queue (same schema checks as external input).
3. If validation fails: print errors. State remains REFINE.
4. If validation passes: transition to PHASE_SHIFT.

#### PHASE_SHIFT (generate_planning_queue → planning)

Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT:

**Without `--from`:**

1. Read `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json` (already validated at REFINE).
2. Populate the plans queue in state.
3. Set `phase` to `"planning"`.
4. Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
5. Pull first plan from queue.
6. Print the planning ORIENT action description.

**With `--from` (override):**

1. Read and validate the plan queue at `--from`.
2. If validation fails: print errors. State remains PHASE_SHIFT.
3. If validation passes: same steps as without `--from`, using the override file.

### Planning → Implementing

The trigger depends on `plan_all_before_implementing`:

- **`false` (default):** PHASE_SHIFT entered after each plan ACCEPT. The remaining plans stay in the planning queue.
- **`true`:** PHASE_SHIFT entered after planning DONE (all plans complete). All completed plans are copied to the implementing plan queue.

#### Entering PHASE_SHIFT
When `false`: the architect advances from planning ACCEPT, and the scaffold transitions to PHASE_SHIFT.
When `true`: the architect advances from planning DONE, and the scaffold transitions to PHASE_SHIFT.

#### Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT
No `--from` needed — the plan.json path is already known from the current or first completed plan.

1. Read plan.json at the plan's file path.
2. Validate the plan structure (same checks as the planning validation gate in plan-production).
3. If validation fails: print errors. State remains PHASE_SHIFT.
4. If validation passes:
   - Add `passes: "pending"` and `rounds: 0` to every item.
   - Write the updated plan.json.
   - Set `phase` to `"implementing"`.
   - Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
   - Print the ORIENT action description with initialization summary.
   - When `true`: populate `implementing.plan_queue` from remaining completed plans.

### Planning → Planning (Domain Boundary)

Only when `plan_all_before_implementing: true`. After each plan ACCEPT (except the last), a PHASE_SHIFT fires between domains within the planning phase.

#### Entering PHASE_SHIFT
The architect advances from ACCEPT with plans remaining in the queue.

#### Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT
1. Pull next plan from queue.
2. Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
3. Print the planning ORIENT action description.

### Implementing → Planning

Only when `plan_all_before_implementing: false`. After implementing DONE for a domain, if plans remain in the planning queue, a PHASE_SHIFT returns to planning.

#### Entering PHASE_SHIFT
The architect advances from implementing DONE with plans remaining in the planning queue.

#### Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT
1. Set `phase` to `"planning"`.
2. Pull next plan from the planning queue.
3. Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
4. Print the planning ORIENT action description.

### Implementing → Implementing (Domain Boundary)

Only when `plan_all_before_implementing: true`. After implementing DONE for a domain, if plans remain in the implementing plan queue, a PHASE_SHIFT fires between domains within the implementing phase.

#### Entering PHASE_SHIFT
The architect advances from implementing DONE with plans remaining in the implementing plan queue.

#### Advancing from PHASE_SHIFT
1. Pull next plan from the implementing plan queue.
2. Read and validate plan.json. Mutate items (add `passes`/`rounds`).
3. Set `state` to `ORIENT`.
4. Print the ORIENT action description with initialization summary.

---

## Invariants

1. **Phase shifts are explicit.** The scaffold always stops at PHASE_SHIFT between phases and at domain boundaries within a phase. It never transitions directly across phase or domain boundaries.
2. **Domain boundaries are phase shifts.** Switching domains always fires a PHASE_SHIFT, whether between phases or within the same phase. This ensures context refresh when the codebase changes.
3. **specifying→planning has input.** The plan queue is either auto-generated (via generate_planning_queue phase) or provided via `--from` override at specifying PHASE_SHIFT (which skips generation).
4. **generate_planning_queue is not directly initializable.** `init --phase generate_planning_queue` is rejected. This phase requires completed specifying data.
5. **Architect controls plan queue ordering.** The auto-generated plan queue is written to a file the architect can review and reorder before it is consumed. Domain ordering in the generated file follows spec queue order (order of first appearance).
6. **planning→implementing validates.** plan.json is validated and mutated on advance out of PHASE_SHIFT.
7. **Guided setting is mutable.** `--guided` / `--no-guided` can change `config.general.user_guided` on any advance call, including at phase shifts.
8. **Interleaved mode (default).** When `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, each domain is planned then implemented before the next domain begins. Implementing DONE returns to planning if plans remain.
9. **All-planning-first mode.** When `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, all domains are planned with PHASE_SHIFT between each domain, then all domains are implemented with PHASE_SHIFT between each domain.
10. **One plan per domain.** Each domain has exactly one plan in the queue. No domain appears more than once.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** Advance from specifying PHASE_SHIFT without `--from`.
  - **Expected:** Transitions to generate_planning_queue ORIENT. Plan queue auto-generated and written to `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`.
  - **Rationale:** Default flow gives the architect a chance to review and reorder the generated queue.

- **Scenario:** Advance from specifying PHASE_SHIFT with `--from` override.
  - **Expected:** External file validated. If valid, skips generate_planning_queue entirely, transitions directly to planning ORIENT.
  - **Rationale:** Override allows full control when the architect has a pre-built plan queue.

- **Scenario:** Advance from specifying PHASE_SHIFT with invalid `--from`.
  - **Expected:** Validation errors printed. State remains PHASE_SHIFT.
  - **Rationale:** Invalid input is rejected at the boundary.

- **Scenario:** generate_planning_queue ORIENT, domain has no `set-roots`.
  - **Expected:** `code_search_roots` defaults to `["<domain>/"]` for that domain in the generated plan queue.
  - **Rationale:** The domain directory itself is the most common search root.

- **Scenario:** Architect edits `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json` during REFINE to reorder domains.
  - **Expected:** Advancing from REFINE validates the edited file. If valid, transitions to PHASE_SHIFT. Planning processes domains in the edited order.
  - **Rationale:** The architect controls domain ordering, not the scaffold.

- **Scenario:** Architect introduces invalid JSON in `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json` during REFINE.
  - **Expected:** Validation errors printed. State remains REFINE. Architect fixes and re-advances.
  - **Rationale:** The plan queue must be valid before transitioning to planning.

- **Scenario:** Advance from generate_planning_queue PHASE_SHIFT with `--from` override.
  - **Expected:** Override file used instead of the auto-generated `<state_dir>/plan-queue.json`. Validated and consumed.
  - **Rationale:** Last-chance override after reviewing the generated queue.

- **Scenario:** Advance from planning→implementing PHASE_SHIFT with invalid plan.json.
  - **Expected:** Validation errors printed. State remains PHASE_SHIFT.
  - **Rationale:** The implementing phase requires a structurally valid plan; errors caught here prevent failures during batch selection.

- **Scenario:** `--guided` provided at PHASE_SHIFT advance.
  - **Expected:** `config.general.user_guided` updated before the phase transition proceeds.
  - **Rationale:** The guided setting is mutable on any advance, including phase shifts, so users can change behavior at natural boundaries.

- **Scenario:** `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, 2 domains. First domain planned and implemented.
  - **Expected:** Implementing DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → planning) → planning ORIENT for second domain.
  - **Rationale:** Interleaved mode cycles between planning and implementing per domain.

- **Scenario:** `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, 1 domain.
  - **Expected:** Planning ACCEPT → PHASE_SHIFT → implementing → DONE → session DONE. No implementing→planning transition.
  - **Rationale:** With one domain, there's no cycling — the flow is linear.

- **Scenario:** `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, 2 domains.
  - **Expected:** Planning domain A → PHASE_SHIFT (planning → planning) → planning domain B → DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (planning → implementing) → implementing domain A → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → implementing) → implementing domain B → DONE → session DONE.
  - **Rationale:** All planning completes with domain-boundary PHASE_SHIFTs, then all implementing with domain-boundary PHASE_SHIFTs.

- **Scenario:** `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, 1 domain.
  - **Expected:** Planning → DONE → PHASE_SHIFT → implementing → DONE → session DONE. No intra-phase PHASE_SHIFTs.
  - **Rationale:** With one domain, no domain boundaries exist within either phase.

- **Scenario:** Implementing DONE with `plan_all_before_implementing: false` and planning queue empty.
  - **Expected:** Session DONE. No transition back to planning.
  - **Rationale:** All domains planned and implemented.

- **Scenario:** Implementing DONE with `plan_all_before_implementing: true` and implementing plan queue empty.
  - **Expected:** Session DONE.
  - **Rationale:** All plans implemented.
