# Spec Reconciliation

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold cross-validates completed specs for cross-domain dependency and integration consistency.

## Context

After all individual specs are completed and all domains have passed cross-referencing (DONE state from spec-lifecycle), the scaffold enters a reconciliation phase. This phase cross-validates dependencies and integration points across all specs and all domains to ensure they are symmetric, consistent, and free of circular references.

Domain-scoped cross-referencing (intra-domain consistency) is handled by CROSS_REFERENCE in spec-lifecycle. Reconciliation focuses on cross-domain concerns: dependencies between specs in different domains, integration point symmetry across domain boundaries, and global naming consistency.

Reconciliation has its own round configuration independent of the per-spec eval rounds. `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` (default 0) controls how many rounds must pass before a PASS verdict can complete the phase. `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds` (default 3) caps the total reconciliation rounds to prevent infinite loops. When `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` is 0, a single PASS immediately completes — this is the default behavior.

When `enable_commits` is `false` (default), `--message` is not required at RECONCILE_EVAL. When `enable_commits` is `true`, `--message` is required with PASS verdict. TODO: automatic git commit execution is not yet implemented.

The scaffold does not spawn sub-agents. It outputs instructions telling the architect what to spawn. The architect (or the skill driving the session) is responsible for spawning them.

## Depends On
- **spec-lifecycle** — provides the completed specs list; DONE state triggers reconciliation.
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| phase-transitions | COMPLETE state transitions to PHASE_SHIFT (specifying → planning) |
| Reconciliation eval sub-agent | Runs `git diff --staged` and evaluates cross-domain consistency across all specs |

---

## Interface

### Inputs

#### `advance` flags — Reconciliation

| State | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS\|FAIL`, `--eval-report <path>` (required), `--message <text>` (required with PASS when `enable_commits: true`) |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | (no flags) |

### Outputs

#### `advance` output

**Entering RECONCILE** (after DONE):

```
State:   RECONCILE
Phase:   specifying
Specs:   5 completed across 2 domains
Action:  Cross-validate all specs across domains: verify Depends On entries,
         Integration Points symmetry, naming consistency. Stage changes with git add.
         After completion of the above, advance to begin evaluation.
```

**Entering RECONCILE_EVAL** (after RECONCILE):

```
State:   RECONCILE_EVAL
Phase:   specifying
Round:   1/3
Action:  Please spawn 1 opus sub-agent to evaluate cross-domain reconciliation.
         The sub-agent runs git diff --staged and evaluates consistency across all specs.
         After completion of the above, advance with --verdict PASS|FAIL --eval-report <path>
```

**Entering RECONCILE_REVIEW** (after first RECONCILE_EVAL PASS >= min_rounds):

RECONCILE_REVIEW always fires once after the first passing reconciliation eval. The action output varies based on `specifying.reconciliation.user_review`:

When `user_review: true`:

```
State:   RECONCILE_REVIEW
Phase:   specifying
Specs:   5 completed across 2 domains
Round:   1/3
Verdict: PASS

Action:  STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing.
         If additional specs are needed,
         write the new spec file, then register it:
           forgectl add-queue-item --name <name> --domain <domain> --topic <topic> --file <file> [--source <path>...]
           Adding specs here re-enters DONE for the new items before reconciliation restarts.
         After completion of the above, advance to continue.
```

When `user_review: false`:

```
State:   RECONCILE_REVIEW
Phase:   specifying
Specs:   5 completed across 2 domains
Round:   1/3
Verdict: PASS

Action:  Reconciliation review complete.
         If additional specs are needed,
         write the new spec file, then register it:
           forgectl add-queue-item --name <name> --domain <domain> --topic <topic> --file <file> [--source <path>...]
           Adding specs here re-enters DONE for the new items before reconciliation restarts.
         After completion of the above, advance to continue.
```

**Entering COMPLETE** (after RECONCILE_REVIEW, or RECONCILE_EVAL PASS on round > 1):

```
State:   COMPLETE
Phase:   specifying
Specs:   5 completed, reconciled
Action:  Specifying phase complete. Advance to continue.
```

### Rejection

| Condition | Signal | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `advance --verdict` outside of RECONCILE_EVAL | Error naming the current state. Exit code 1. | Verdict is only valid in evaluation states |
| `advance` in RECONCILE_EVAL without `--verdict` | Error. Exit code 1. | Verdict determines the transition |
| `advance` in RECONCILE_EVAL without `--eval-report` | Error. Exit code 1. | Every evaluation must reference its report |
| `add-queue-item` outside of RECONCILE_REVIEW within reconciliation | Error: "add-queue-item is only valid in RECONCILE_REVIEW during reconciliation (current state: \<state\>)." Exit code 1. | Queue modifications during reconciliation are restricted to the review checkpoint |

## Behavior

### State Machine

```
DONE → RECONCILE → RECONCILE_EVAL
                        │
              ┌─────────┼──────────┐
              │         │          │
        PASS ≥ min   PASS < min  FAIL < max
              │         │          │
              ▼         ▼          ▼
         (continue)  RECONCILE  RECONCILE
              │
         round == 1?         FAIL ≥ max → (continue, forced)
           yes → RECONCILE_REVIEW → COMPLETE
           no → COMPLETE

(continue) = RECONCILE_REVIEW if round == 1 (always),
             otherwise COMPLETE
```

### Transition Table

| From State | Condition | To State | Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| DONE | always | RECONCILE | Initialize reconcile state with round 0. |
| RECONCILE | always | RECONCILE_EVAL | Increment reconcile round. |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round >= `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds`, round == 1 | RECONCILE_REVIEW | Record eval. Always enters RECONCILE_REVIEW on first passing eval. TODO: Auto-commit with `--message` when `enable_commits: true`. |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round >= `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds`, round > 1 | COMPLETE | Record eval. TODO: Auto-commit with `--message` when `enable_commits: true`. |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round < `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` | RECONCILE | Record eval (PASS). Min rounds not met. |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict FAIL`, round < `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds` | RECONCILE | Record eval (FAIL). |
| RECONCILE_EVAL | `--verdict FAIL`, round >= `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds` | RECONCILE_REVIEW or COMPLETE | Record eval (FAIL). Forced. If round == 1: RECONCILE_REVIEW. Else: COMPLETE. |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | queue empty | COMPLETE | Advance to completion. |
| RECONCILE_REVIEW | queue non-empty (via add-queue-item) | DONE | Re-enter DONE to process new specs. Reconciliation restarts after new specs complete. |
| COMPLETE | always | PHASE_SHIFT | Set phase shift from specifying → planning. |

### Reconcile Evaluation Sub-Agent

The reconciliation eval focuses on cross-domain concerns. The sub-agent:
1. Runs `git diff --staged` to see all changes
2. Reads all completed spec files across all domains
3. Checks:
   - Every `Depends On` reference points to a spec that exists
   - Every cross-domain dependency has a corresponding `Integration Points` entry in the target spec
   - Integration Points are symmetric across domain boundaries (if A lists B, B lists A)
   - Spec names are consistent across all cross-domain references
   - No circular dependencies exist in the cross-domain dependency graph

Intra-domain consistency (specs within the same domain) is already verified by CROSS_REFERENCE in spec-lifecycle.

---

## Invariants

1. **Reconciliation follows completion.** DONE always transitions to RECONCILE. All specs and domain cross-references must be complete before cross-domain validation.
2. **Reconcile min rounds enforced.** PASS below `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` routes back to RECONCILE, not COMPLETE.
3. **Reconcile max rounds enforced.** FAIL at `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds` forces COMPLETE to prevent indefinite loops.
4. **Independent round config.** `specifying.reconciliation.*` is independent of `specifying.eval.*` and `specifying.cross_reference.*`.
5. **Commit gating.** `--message` is only required when `enable_commits` is `true`.
6. **Cross-domain focus.** Reconciliation checks cross-domain boundaries. Intra-domain consistency is handled by CROSS_REFERENCE.
7. **Reconciliation review fires once.** RECONCILE_REVIEW is entered exactly once after the first passing (or forced) RECONCILE_EVAL, regardless of `specifying.reconciliation.user_review`.
8. **user_review controls output, not state entry.** When `user_review` is true, RECONCILE_REVIEW includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing." When false, it says "Reconciliation review complete."
9. **add-queue-item at RECONCILE_REVIEW re-enters DONE.** New specs added here go through the full drafting loop, then reconciliation restarts.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** Reconciliation eval finds no issues on first pass, `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` is 0 (default).
  - **Expected:** RECONCILE → RECONCILE_EVAL with `--verdict PASS` → RECONCILE_REVIEW → COMPLETE.
  - **Rationale:** When `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` is 0, a single PASS triggers the review checkpoint, then completes.

- **Scenario:** PASS verdict at round 1 with `specifying.reconciliation.min_rounds` set to 2.
  - **Expected:** RECONCILE_EVAL → RECONCILE (min rounds not met).
  - **Rationale:** Even with a passing verdict, minimum reconciliation rounds must be completed when configured.

- **Scenario:** FAIL verdict at `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds`, round 1.
  - **Expected:** RECONCILE_EVAL → RECONCILE_REVIEW (forced, but review checkpoint still fires on round 1).
  - **Rationale:** Even on forced completion, the review checkpoint fires once for the architect to add late-discovered specs.

- **Scenario:** FAIL verdict at `specifying.reconciliation.max_rounds`, round > 1.
  - **Expected:** RECONCILE_EVAL → COMPLETE (forced).
  - **Rationale:** Review already happened on round 1. Max rounds exhausted.

- **Scenario:** All specs are in the same domain (no cross-domain boundaries).
  - **Expected:** Reconciliation still runs but the sub-agent finds no cross-domain issues. Single PASS → RECONCILE_REVIEW → COMPLETE.
  - **Rationale:** Reconciliation is mandatory in the state machine. When there are no cross-domain concerns, it passes trivially.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called at RECONCILE_REVIEW.
  - **Expected:** Queue populated. Advancing from RECONCILE_REVIEW re-enters DONE. New specs go through ORIENT → DRAFT → EVALUATE → ACCEPT → CROSS_REFERENCE → CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW → DONE → RECONCILE (reconciliation restarts).
  - **Rationale:** Cross-domain gaps discovered during reconciliation require new specs that must be drafted, evaluated, cross-referenced, then reconciled again.

- **Scenario:** RECONCILE_REVIEW with `user_review: false`.
  - **Expected:** State entered. Action says "Reconciliation review complete." No user review prompt. add-queue-item available.
  - **Rationale:** Review checkpoint always fires for add-queue-item. user_review only controls the review prompt.
