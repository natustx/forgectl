# Plan Production

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold produces a validated implementation plan through a study-draft-evaluate cycle.

## Context

The planning phase guides the architect through studying specs, codebase, and packages, then drafting an implementation plan as structured JSON (`plan.json`) with accompanying notes. The plan is validated against a structural schema and evaluated through iterative sub-agent review rounds until accepted (or force-accepted at max rounds).

## Depends On
- **phase-transitions** — the generate_planning_queue→planning phase shift provides the plans queue and triggers ORIENT.
- **session-init** — alternatively, `init --phase planning` starts the planning phase directly.
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| SPEC_MANIFEST.md | STUDY_SPECS reads this manifest to locate spec files relevant to the plan |
| Plan format definition (`PLAN_FORMAT.md`) | Defines the JSON schema for `plan.json` and conventions for notes files. Referenced during REVIEW, DRAFT, and validation. |
| Plan evaluator prompt (`evaluators/plan-eval.md`, embedded in binary) | Full instructions for the planning evaluation sub-agent: dimensions, report format, verdict rules |
| phase-transitions | ACCEPT transitions to PHASE_SHIFT (planning → implementing) |

## Interface

### Inputs

#### `advance` flags — Planning Phase

| State | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS\|FAIL` (required), `--eval-report <path>` (required when `enable_eval_output: true`) |
| ACCEPT | `--message <text>` / `-m` (required when `enable_commits: true`) |

#### `eval` command

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `eval` | none | Output full evaluation context for the sub-agent. Only valid in planning EVALUATE. |

#### `eval` output

When `enable_eval_output: true`:

```
=== PLAN EVALUATION ROUND 1/3 ===
Plan:   Service Configuration
Domain: launcher
File:   launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/plan.json

--- EVALUATOR INSTRUCTIONS ---

<contents of evaluators/plan-eval.md>

--- PLAN REFERENCES ---

Plan:    launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/plan.json
Format:  PLAN_FORMAT.md
Specs:
  - launcher/specs/service-configuration.md

--- REPORT OUTPUT ---

Write your evaluation report to:
  launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/evals/round-1.md
```

Subsequent rounds with `enable_eval_output: true` include previous evaluations:

```

#### Eval Report Locations

Planning eval reports:
```
<domain>/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/evals/round-N.md
```

#### `status` output — Planning (compact)

The compact `status` output for planning shows the current plan, round, action, and progress:

When `enable_eval_output: true`:

```
Plan:    Service Configuration (launcher)
File:    launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/plan.json
Round:   1/3

Action:  Run evaluation sub-agent against the plan (round 1/3).
         Sub-agent: forgectl eval
         Advance with --verdict PASS|FAIL --eval-report <path>.

Progress: round 1 of 3
```

When `enable_eval_output: false`:

```
Plan:    Service Configuration (launcher)
File:    launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/plan.json
Round:   1/3

Action:  Run evaluation sub-agent against the plan (round 1/3).
         Sub-agent: forgectl eval
         Advance with --verdict PASS|FAIL.

Progress: round 1 of 3
```

#### `status --verbose` output — Planning section

With `--verbose`, the eval history is appended.

When `enable_eval_output: true`:

```
--- Planning ---

  Accepted (2 rounds)
    Round 1: FAIL — launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/evals/round-1.md
    Round 2: PASS — launcher/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/evals/round-2.md
```

When `enable_eval_output: false`:

```
--- Planning ---

  Accepted (2 rounds)
    Round 1: FAIL
    Round 2: PASS
```

When no evals yet:

```
--- Planning ---

  Evals: (none yet)
```

### Rejection

| Condition | Signal | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `advance` in planning EVALUATE without `--verdict` | Error. Exit code 1. | Verdict determines the transition |
| `advance` in planning EVALUATE without `--eval-report` when `enable_eval_output: true` | Error. Exit code 1. | Every evaluation must reference its report when eval output is enabled |
| `advance --eval-report` pointing to non-existent file | Error naming the path. Exit code 1. | Report must exist to be recorded |
| `advance --eval-report` when `enable_eval_output: false` | Warning: `--eval-report is ignored, eval output is not enabled`. Command proceeds. | Consistent with `--message` warning pattern |
| `advance` in planning ACCEPT without `--message` when `enable_commits: true` | Error. Exit code 1. | Accepted plans need a commit message when commits are enabled |
| `eval` outside of planning EVALUATE | Error naming current state and phase. Exit code 1. | Eval context only available in EVALUATE |
| `advance` in DONE with any flags | Error: "DONE is a pass-through state. No flags accepted." Exit code 1. | DONE only transitions to PHASE_SHIFT |

### Study Phases

Three study phases build context before drafting. No flags required — the architect studies, then advances.

#### STUDY_SPECS
Study the specs listed in `current_plan.specs` and the SPEC_MANIFEST.md: full spec files, git diffs, dependencies, cross-references.

#### STUDY_CODE
Explore the codebase using sub-agents within `current_plan.code_search_roots`, focused on finding code relevant to the specs in `current_plan.specs`. The output lists both the search roots and the spec file paths so sub-agents know what to look for. Sub-agent count is configured via `planning.study_code.count` (default 3).

#### STUDY_PACKAGES
Study the project's technical stack: package manifests, library documentation, CLAUDE.md references.

### REVIEW Phase

Lightweight checkpoint before drafting. Outputs the path to `PLAN_FORMAT.md`. The architect reviews study findings and the plan format, then advances to DRAFT.

### DRAFT Phase

The architect generates the implementation plan as structured JSON with accompanying notes:

```
<domain>/.forge_workspace/implementation_plan/
├── plan.json
└── notes/
    ├── <package>.md
    └── ...
```

### Validation Gate

Fires automatically when advancing from DRAFT, REFINE, or SELF_REVIEW. Not a phase where the architect does work.

#### Validation Checks

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| JSON parse | File exists and contains valid JSON |
| Top-level fields | `context`, `refs`, `layers`, `items` present and correctly typed |
| Context fields | `domain` and `module` are non-empty strings |
| Refs exist | Every path in `refs` resolves to an existing file |
| Item schema | Every item has `id`, `name`, `description`, `depends_on`, `specs`, `refs`, `files`, `tests` |
| Item ID uniqueness | No duplicate item IDs |
| Layer coverage | Every item in exactly one layer; every layer item ID exists |
| Layer ordering | Items only depend on items in equal or earlier layers |
| DAG validity | `depends_on` references are valid; no cycles |
| Test schema | Every test has `category`, `description`, `passes` with correct types |
| Test categories | One of: `functional`, `rejection`, `edge_case` |
| Notes files | Every path in `items[].refs` resolves to an existing notes file (relative to plan.json directory) |

**On pass:** transitions directly to EVALUATE. VALIDATE is never visible.

**On fail:** enters VALIDATE, prints errors with field descriptions. Loops until valid.

### EVALUATE Phase

Uses `eval` command to output full evaluation context for the sub-agent. The evaluator prompt (`evaluators/plan-eval.md`) defines 11 assessment dimensions.

### REFINE Phase

Action varies by verdict and `enable_eval_output`:
- When `enable_eval_output: true`: outputs the eval report path with "Study the eval file" instruction.
- When `enable_eval_output: false`: "Make corrections based off communication with the evaluator."
- After PASS below min_rounds: prefixed with "Minimum evaluation rounds not met."

Advancing from REFINE runs the validation gate.

---

## Invariants

1. **Study phases precede REVIEW.** STUDY_SPECS → STUDY_CODE → STUDY_PACKAGES → REVIEW. No phase is skipped.
2. **Validation precedes evaluation.** The validation gate runs before every EVALUATE entry (and before SELF_REVIEW when enabled).
3. **Self-review is optional.** When `planning.self_review` is `true`, SELF_REVIEW is entered between validation and EVALUATE on every round. When `false` (default), SELF_REVIEW is skipped. The validation gate also runs on advance from SELF_REVIEW in case the agent revised plan.json.
4. **Round monotonicity.** The planning round counter only increments.
5. **Min rounds enforced.** PASS below `planning.eval.min_rounds` forces another cycle.
6. **Max rounds enforced.** FAIL at `planning.eval.max_rounds` forces acceptance.
7. **Guided pauses.** When `config.general.user_guided` is true, REVIEW output includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing."
8. **Per-plan commits at ACCEPT.** When `enable_commits` is `true`, `--message` is required at ACCEPT and the scaffold auto-commits per `planning.commit_strategy`. When `enable_commits` is `false`, `--message` is not shown in output; if provided, a warning is printed: `--message is ignored, commits are not enabled`. The warning does not instruct how to enable commits. The commit hash is automatically registered on the accepted plan.
9. **Batch limitation.** `planning.batch` > 1 is not yet supported. Reserved for future use.
10. **DONE only reachable when `plan_all_before_implementing: true`.** When `false`, ACCEPT always transitions to PHASE_SHIFT (planning → implementing) — DONE is never entered. When `true`, DONE is entered when the queue is empty.
11. **No plan addition at DONE.** Unlike specifying's DONE which allows `add-queue-item`, planning's DONE does not accept new plans. The rationale is that the `plan-queue.json` is the authoritative source for all plans that need to be created in this session.
12. **Domain boundaries are phase shifts.** When `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, PHASE_SHIFT fires between domains within planning. This ensures context refresh when switching codebases.
13. **Path resolution is context-dependent.** `refs[].path` and `items[].refs` are resolved relative to the plan.json directory (`<domain>/<workspace_dir>/implementation_plan/`). `items[].files` and `items[].specs` are resolved relative to the project root.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** Validation passes on first try after DRAFT, `self_review: false`.
  - **Expected:** Transitions directly to EVALUATE in one `advance` call.
  - **Rationale:** VALIDATE is a gate, not a user-facing state. When the plan is valid and self-review is disabled, the architect never sees VALIDATE.

- **Scenario:** Validation passes on first try after DRAFT, `self_review: true`.
  - **Expected:** Transitions to SELF_REVIEW in one `advance` call.
  - **Rationale:** Self-review gives the agent a chance to revise before evaluation.

- **Scenario:** Agent revises plan.json during SELF_REVIEW and introduces validation errors.
  - **Expected:** Advancing from SELF_REVIEW runs the validation gate. Validation fails, enters VALIDATE.
  - **Rationale:** The validation gate always runs before EVALUATE, even after self-review.

- **Scenario:** Validation fails after REFINE.
  - **Expected:** Enters VALIDATE loop.
  - **Rationale:** Refinement may introduce structural errors; the validation gate catches them before re-evaluation.

- **Scenario:** plan.json does not exist when validation runs.
  - **Expected:** Validation fails with file-not-found.
  - **Rationale:** The plan must physically exist to be validated. Missing file is the first check.

- **Scenario:** plan.json has a dependency cycle.
  - **Expected:** Validation fails listing the cycle.
  - **Rationale:** Cycles make layer ordering impossible. The DAG check detects and reports them.

- **Scenario:** `--eval-report` points to non-existent file.
  - **Expected:** Error. State unchanged.
  - **Rationale:** Eval reports are audit artifacts. Accepting a reference to a non-existent file would leave a broken trail.

- **Scenario:** ACCEPT with `enable_commits: true` and no files changed.
  - **Expected:** Commit skipped. Notice printed. Advance proceeds.
  - **Rationale:** Empty commits are not created. See `docs/auto-committing.md`.

- **Scenario:** ACCEPT with `enable_commits: false` and `--message` provided.
  - **Expected:** Warning: `--message is ignored, commits are not enabled`. Command proceeds. The warning does not instruct how to enable commits.
  - **Rationale:** Users who do not need auto-commits should not be confused or prompted to change configuration.

- **Scenario:** Multiple plans in queue (future: `planning.batch` > 1).
  - **Expected:** ACCEPT loops to ORIENT for next plan. DONE reached when queue empty.
  - **Rationale:** Each plan is an independent domain artifact. Per-plan commits at ACCEPT keep the git history clean.

## Testing Criteria

### Study phases advance sequentially
- **Verifies:** Sequential state progression through study phases.
- **Given:** ORIENT (planning).
- **When:** advance through STUDY_SPECS → STUDY_CODE → STUDY_PACKAGES → REVIEW → DRAFT.
- **Then:** Each transitions in order.

### DRAFT with valid plan goes to EVALUATE when self_review is false
- **Verifies:** Validation gate passes transparently, self-review skipped.
- **Given:** DRAFT, plan.json valid, `planning.self_review: false`.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is EVALUATE. Round is 1.

### DRAFT with valid plan goes to SELF_REVIEW when self_review is true
- **Verifies:** Self-review entered after validation passes.
- **Given:** DRAFT, plan.json valid, `planning.self_review: true`.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is SELF_REVIEW. Round is 1.

### SELF_REVIEW with valid plan goes to EVALUATE
- **Verifies:** Self-review advances to evaluation.
- **Given:** SELF_REVIEW, plan.json valid.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is EVALUATE.

### SELF_REVIEW with invalid plan enters VALIDATE
- **Verifies:** Validation gate catches errors after self-review revision.
- **Given:** SELF_REVIEW, agent revised plan.json and introduced errors.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is VALIDATE.

### DRAFT with invalid plan enters VALIDATE
- **Verifies:** Validation gate catches errors.
- **Given:** DRAFT, plan.json invalid.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is VALIDATE.

### VALIDATE loops until valid
- **Verifies:** VALIDATE rejects until plan is fixed.
- **Given:** VALIDATE, plan.json still invalid.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** Stays VALIDATE. Exit code 1.

### Planning EVALUATE PASS at min_rounds → ACCEPT
- **Verifies:** PASS with sufficient rounds triggers acceptance.
- **Given:** EVALUATE, min_rounds: 1, round 1.
- **When:** `advance --verdict PASS --eval-report evals/round-1.md`
- **Then:** State is ACCEPT.

### Planning EVALUATE FAIL at max_rounds → ACCEPT (forced)
- **Verifies:** FAIL at max rounds forces acceptance.
- **Given:** EVALUATE, max_rounds: 2, round 2.
- **When:** `advance --verdict FAIL --eval-report evals/round-2.md`
- **Then:** State is ACCEPT.

### Planning ACCEPT → DONE (queue empty)
- **Verifies:** Acceptance with empty queue reaches DONE.
- **Given:** ACCEPT (planning), queue empty.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is DONE.

### Planning DONE → PHASE_SHIFT
- **Verifies:** DONE transitions to phase shift.
- **Given:** DONE (planning).
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is PHASE_SHIFT.

### Planning ACCEPT auto-commits when enable_commits is true
- **Verifies:** Per-plan commit at ACCEPT.
- **Given:** ACCEPT, `enable_commits: true`, `planning.commit_strategy: "strict"`. Plan files modified.
- **When:** `advance --message "Accept service configuration plan"`
- **Then:** Files staged per `strict` strategy. `git commit` executed. Hash registered on accepted plan. State is DONE.

### Planning ACCEPT ignores --message when enable_commits is false
- **Verifies:** Warning printed, command proceeds.
- **Given:** ACCEPT, `enable_commits: false`.
- **When:** `advance --message "ignored"`
- **Then:** Warning: `--message is ignored, commits are not enabled`. State is DONE. Warning does not instruct how to enable commits.

### Planning eval command outputs context
- **Verifies:** Eval command assembles full evaluation context.
- **Given:** EVALUATE (planning), round 1.
- **When:** `forgectl eval`
- **Then:** Output includes plan-eval.md contents, plan references, report target.

- Domain artifacts in `.forge_workspace/`
- Dual evaluator prompts: plan-eval.md for planning sub-agent
- `planning.batch` > 1: reserved for future use
