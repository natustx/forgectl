# Spec Lifecycle

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold sequences batched spec drafting through iterative evaluation rounds, with domain-scoped cross-referencing after each domain completes.

## Context

The specifying phase guides an architect through drafting, evaluating, refining, and accepting specs from a queue. Specs are processed in batches of up to `specifying.batch` (default 3), grouped by domain — a batch never mixes domains. If a domain has more specs than the batch size, it produces multiple batches before moving to the next domain.

The eval sub-agent evaluates all specs in the batch together. The entire batch cycles through DRAFT → EVALUATE → REFINE until accepted (or force-accepted at `specifying.eval.max_rounds`). Accepted specs move to the completed list and the next batch is pulled from the queue.

After the last batch for a domain is accepted, the scaffold enters a domain-scoped CROSS_REFERENCE phase. This cross-references ALL specs in the domain (session specs and existing specs) before moving to the next domain.

When `enable_commits` is `true`, the specifying phase produces a single commit at COMPLETE (in spec-reconciliation) covering all spec work. No commits are made during individual eval rounds, refinements, or cross-referencing. See `docs/auto-committing.md` for full auto-commit behavior and staging strategies.

The scaffold does not spawn sub-agents. It outputs instructions telling the architect what to spawn. The architect (or the skill driving the session) is responsible for spawning them.

This spec covers the spec lifecycle from ORIENT through DONE. Cross-domain reconciliation after all specs are complete is covered by spec-reconciliation.

## Depends On
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.
- **session-init** — populates the spec queue during `init --phase specifying`.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| Specs skill | The DRAFT and REFINE action outputs reference skill files (`references/spec-format.md`, `references/spec-generation-skill.md`, `references/topic-of-concern.md`) that define the authoring process; the scaffold enforces the state machine that sequences it |
| Spec evaluation prompt (`evaluators/spec-eval.md`, embedded in binary) | Full instructions for the spec evaluation sub-agent: what to check, report format, verdict rules |
| Cross-reference evaluation prompt (`evaluators/cross-reference-eval.md`, embedded in binary) | Full instructions for the cross-reference evaluation sub-agent |
| Spec generation sub-agent | The specifying EVALUATE state is where the architect spawns a sub-agent to evaluate the batch; the scaffold tracks round count, verdict, and eval report path |
| spec-reconciliation | Receives the completed specs list when the queue is exhausted (DONE state) |
| spec-reconciliation | Completed specs receive commit hashes (via `commit_hashes` field) through auto-commit at COMPLETE when `enable_commits: true` |
| Eval output directory | The specifying eval sub-agent writes output to `<domain>/specs/.eval/`; the scaffold does not read these files but the convention is documented |
| phase-transitions | Completed specs, commit hashes, and code search roots feed into auto-generated plan-queue at generate_planning_queue phase |

## Behavior

### Batch Selection

At ORIENT, the scaffold selects up to `specifying.batch` specs from the front of the queue, all from the same domain. Specs are pulled in queue order. Domain boundaries are batch boundaries — the batch ends when the domain changes or the batch size is reached.

### Domain Path

Each spec in the queue includes a `domain_path` — the filesystem path to the domain directory (e.g., `optimizer/`). The scaffold uses this to:
- Display shorter spec file paths (relative to `<domain_path>/specs/`)
- Discover all `.md` files in `<domain_path>/specs/` for cross-referencing
- The state file stores spec filenames only (e.g., `repository-loading.md`), not full paths. Full paths are reconstructed as `<domain_path>/specs/<filename>`.

### State Machine

### Eval Output Convention

The specifying evaluation sub-agent writes structured markdown to a known directory:

```
<domain>/specs/.eval/
├── batch-1-r1.md
├── batch-1-r2.md
├── cross-reference-r1.md
├── cross-reference-r2.md
└── ...
```

The scaffold does not read or write these files. This is a convention for the architect and sub-agent. The eval sub-agent evaluates all specs in the batch together in a single report.

### Add Queue Item

`forgectl add-queue-item` appends a spec to the end of the specifying queue. It does not affect the current batch.

1. Validate the current phase is `specifying`.
2. Validate the current state is DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW.
3. Validate all required flags: `--name`, `--topic`, `--file`.
4. Validate `--file` points to an existing file. If not: error with message instructing the architect to create the file first.
5. Validate `--file` matches `<something>/specs/<name>.md` pattern. If not: error `File path must follow <domain>/specs/<name>.md convention.`
6. Derive domain from `--file`: extract the path prefix before `/specs/` (e.g., `domains/emails/specs/smtp-relay.md` → `domains/emails`).
7. Resolve domain:
   a. Check configured domains (`config.domains`): does any domain's `path` match the derived path?
   b. If no configured domains, check session domains (queue + completed specs): does any existing domain path match?
   c. **If `--domain` is omitted:**
      - If a matching domain is found (configured or session): use it. Print `Added <name> to specifying queue for domain <domain_name>.`
      - If no match: error `No matching domain for file <file>. Use --domain to register a new domain.`
   d. **If `--domain` is provided:**
      - Derive the domain name from the file path. If `--domain` does not match: error `Domain in --domain (<domain>) does not match the domain in file <file> (<derived_domain>).`
      - If the domain exists (configured or session): use it.
      - If the domain is new: validate the new domain path does not nest within or contain any existing domain path. Register as a session-only domain.
8. Validate `--name` is unique across both the queue and completed specs.
9. Append the new entry to the end of `specifying.queue`.
10. Write the state file.
11. Print confirmation: spec name, domain, domain_path, and queue position. E.g., `Added smtp-relay to specifying queue for domain emails.`

When `add-queue-item` is used at DONE and the queue was previously empty, advancing from DONE re-enters ORIENT for the new items. After those items complete (including their domain's cross-reference), the scaffold returns to DONE. Reconciliation does not begin until the queue is empty again.

### Set Roots

`forgectl set-roots` stores code search roots for a domain. These roots are used during plan-queue generation in the generate_planning_queue phase.

1. Validate the current phase is `specifying`.
2. Validate the current state is CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW or DONE.
3. Resolve domain: if `--domain` is provided, use it. Otherwise, infer from the current cross-reference domain at CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW. At DONE, `--domain` is required (no current domain).
4. Validate the resolved domain has completed specs.
5. Validate at least one positional path argument is provided.
6. Store the roots in `specifying.domains[<domain>].code_search_roots`.
7. Write the state file.
8. Print confirmation: domain and roots.

Calling `set-roots` for a domain that already has roots overwrites the previous value.

---

## Invariants

1. **Batch is domain-homogeneous.** All specs in a batch share the same domain.
2. **Round monotonicity.** The specifying round counter only increments.
3. **Queue order preserved.** Specs are pulled from the front of the queue.
4. **Min rounds enforced.** PASS below `specifying.eval.min_rounds` forces another cycle.
5. **Max rounds enforced.** FAIL at `specifying.eval.max_rounds` forces acceptance.
6. **Guided pauses.** When `config.general.user_guided` is true, SELECT output includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing."
7. **No commits during specifying lifecycle.** Individual eval rounds, refinements, and cross-referencing do not produce commits. The single specifying commit occurs at COMPLETE (see spec-reconciliation).
8. **Domain cross-reference required.** Every domain passes through CROSS_REFERENCE before the next domain begins or DONE is reached.
9. **Cross-reference scans all domain specs.** CROSS_REFERENCE discovers all `.md` files in `<domain_path>/specs/`, not just session specs.
10. **Domain checkpoint fires once.** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW is entered exactly once per domain (after the first passing CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL), regardless of `user_review` setting.
11. **user_review controls output, not state entry.** When `user_review` is true, the CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW action includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing." When false, it says "Domain cross-reference complete." The state is entered either way.
12. **add-queue-item is state-gated.** Only valid in DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW within the specifying phase.
13. **set-roots is state-gated.** Only valid in CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW or DONE within the specifying phase.
14. **add-queue-item names are unique.** No duplicate names across queue and completed specs.
15. **DONE re-enters ORIENT when queue is non-empty.** If `add-queue-item` populates the queue at DONE, advancing re-enters ORIENT instead of RECONCILE.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round < `specifying.eval.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** REFINE.
  - **Rationale:** More evaluation rounds remain; the architect gets another chance to address deficiencies.

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round >= `specifying.eval.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** ACCEPT (forced).
  - **Rationale:** The maximum rounds are exhausted. The batch is accepted as-is to prevent indefinite loops.

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict PASS` when round < `specifying.eval.min_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** REFINE (min rounds not met).
  - **Rationale:** Even with a passing verdict, minimum evaluation rounds must be completed to ensure sufficient review.

- **Scenario:** Domain has fewer specs remaining than `specifying.batch`.
  - **Expected:** Batch contains all remaining specs for that domain.
  - **Rationale:** Batches are capped at `specifying.batch` but may be smaller. No padding occurs.

- **Scenario:** `enable_commits` is `false` and architect provides `--message` at any specifying state.
  - **Expected:** Warning printed: `--message is ignored, commits are not enabled`. Command proceeds. The warning does not instruct how to enable commits.
  - **Rationale:** Users who do not need auto-commits should not be confused or prompted to change configuration.

- **Scenario:** Domain has no existing specs outside the queue (all specs are new).
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE lists only session specs under `[session — completed]`. `[existing — not in queue]` section is empty or omitted.
  - **Rationale:** Cross-referencing still runs to verify consistency among the new specs.

- **Scenario:** CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL FAIL at `specifying.cross_reference.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** Forced acceptance. Advance to next domain (ORIENT) or DONE.
  - **Rationale:** Maximum cross-reference rounds exhausted. Prevents indefinite loops.

- **Scenario:** First CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL passes, `user_review` is true.
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW with "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing." in action output.
  - **Rationale:** Domain checkpoint always fires. `user_review` adds the review prompt.

- **Scenario:** First CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL passes, `user_review` is false.
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW with "Domain cross-reference complete." in action output. No user review prompt.
  - **Rationale:** Domain checkpoint always fires for set-roots and add-queue-item collection. `user_review` only controls the review prompt.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called during EVALUATE.
  - **Expected:** Error: "add-queue-item is only valid in DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW states (current state: EVALUATE)." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Queue modifications are restricted to states where the architect is the actor with sufficient context.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with a name that already exists in the queue.
  - **Expected:** Error: "spec name '<name>' already exists in queue." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Duplicate names create ambiguity in status output, depends_on references, and completed specs tracking.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called at DONE when queue is empty, then advance.
  - **Expected:** Advance re-enters ORIENT. The new spec is pulled into a batch. After acceptance and cross-reference, returns to DONE.
  - **Rationale:** DONE only advances to RECONCILE when the queue is empty. Adding items re-opens the drafting loop.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called during DRAFT for a different domain than the current batch.
  - **Expected:** Item appended to queue. Current batch continues unaffected. The new item is processed when its domain comes up in queue order.
  - **Rationale:** Queue append does not disturb the current batch.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item --file domains/emails/specs/smtp-relay.md` without `--domain`. Domain `emails` is configured in `[[domains]]`.
  - **Expected:** Domain resolved to `emails`. Print: `Added smtp-relay to specifying queue for domain emails.`
  - **Rationale:** Configured domains are matched by path prefix.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item --file new-service/specs/auth.md` without `--domain`. No configured or session domain matches.
  - **Expected:** Error: `No matching domain for file new-service/specs/auth.md. Use --domain to register a new domain.`
  - **Rationale:** New domains require explicit intent via `--domain`.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item --domain portal --file optimizer/specs/foo.md`.
  - **Expected:** Error: `Domain in --domain (portal) does not match the domain in file optimizer/specs/foo.md (optimizer).`
  - **Rationale:** Domain name and file path must agree to prevent misclassification.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item --domain users-admin --file domains/users/admin/specs/roles.md`. Existing domain `users` has path `domains/users`.
  - **Expected:** Error: `Domain paths must not be nested: domains/users is a prefix of domains/users/admin.`
  - **Rationale:** Nested domains create ambiguity in file-to-domain resolution.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item --file shared/lib/something.md`.
  - **Expected:** Error: `File path must follow <domain>/specs/<name>.md convention.`
  - **Rationale:** Spec files must reside in a domain's `specs/` directory.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with `--file` pointing to a file that does not exist.
  - **Expected:** Error: "file <path> does not exist. add-queue-item registers specs that have already been written. Create the spec file first, then register it." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** `add-queue-item` is for registering existing work, not queuing future work. The architect must write the spec before registering it.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with `--file` whose derived `domain_path` conflicts with an existing domain's path.
  - **Expected:** Error naming the conflict. Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Prevents silent domain_path mismatches that would break cross-referencing and file discovery.

- **Scenario:** `set-roots` called for a domain with no completed specs.
  - **Expected:** Error: "domain '<domain>' has no completed specs." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Roots are collected for domains that have been specified. Setting roots for an unknown domain is likely a typo.

- **Scenario:** `set-roots` called twice for the same domain.
  - **Expected:** Second call overwrites the first. No error.
  - **Rationale:** The architect may refine their understanding of code locations.

- **Scenario:** Phase shift to planning with no `set-roots` called for a domain.
  - **Expected:** `code_search_roots` defaults to `["<domain>/"]` in the generated plan-queue entry.
  - **Rationale:** The domain directory itself is the most common search root. Explicit roots override the default.
