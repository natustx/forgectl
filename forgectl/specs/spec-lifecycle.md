# Spec Lifecycle

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold sequences batched spec drafting through iterative evaluation rounds, with domain-scoped cross-referencing after each domain completes.

## Context

The specifying phase guides an architect through drafting, evaluating, refining, and accepting specs from a queue. Specs are processed in batches of up to `specifying.batch` (default 3), grouped by domain — a batch never mixes domains. If a domain has more specs than the batch size, it produces multiple batches before moving to the next domain.

The eval sub-agent evaluates all specs in the batch together. The entire batch cycles through DRAFT → EVALUATE → REFINE until accepted (or force-accepted at `specifying.eval.max_rounds`). Accepted specs move to the completed list and the next batch is pulled from the queue.

After the last batch for a domain is accepted, the scaffold enters a domain-scoped CROSS_REFERENCE phase. This cross-references ALL specs in the domain (session specs and existing specs) before moving to the next domain.

When `enable_commits` is `false` (default), `--message` is not required at any state. When `enable_commits` is `true`, `--message` is required at EVALUATE with PASS verdict. TODO: automatic git commit execution is not yet implemented.

The scaffold does not spawn sub-agents. It outputs instructions telling the architect what to spawn. The architect (or the skill driving the session) is responsible for spawning them.

This spec covers the spec lifecycle from ORIENT through DONE. Cross-domain reconciliation after all specs are complete is covered by spec-reconciliation.

## Depends On
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.
- **session-init** — populates the spec queue during `init --phase specifying`.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| Specs skill | The DRAFT and REFINE action outputs reference skill files (`references/spec-format.md`, `references/spec-generation-skill.md`, `references/topic-of-concern.md`) that define the authoring process; the scaffold enforces the state machine that sequences it |
| Spec generation sub-agent | The specifying EVALUATE state is where the architect spawns a sub-agent to evaluate the batch; the scaffold tracks round count, verdict, and eval report path |
| spec-reconciliation | Receives the completed specs list when the queue is exhausted (DONE state) |
| commit-tracking | Completed specs receive commit hashes (via `commit_hashes` field) through add-commit and reconcile-commit |
| Eval output directory | The specifying eval sub-agent writes output to `<domain>/specs/.eval/`; the scaffold does not read these files but the convention is documented |
| phase-transitions | Completed specs, commit hashes, and code search roots feed into auto-generated plan-queue at specifying→planning phase shift |

## Interface

### Inputs

#### `advance` flags — Specifying Phase

| State | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| DRAFT | (no flags) |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS\|FAIL`, `--eval-report <path>` (required), `--message <text>` (required with PASS when `enable_commits: true`) |
| REFINE | (no flags) |
| CROSS_REFERENCE | (no flags) |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS\|FAIL`, `--eval-report <path>` (required) |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW | (no flags) |

The `--guided` / `--no-guided` flags are accepted on any `advance` call regardless of state.

#### `add-queue-item` — Add spec to queue

Appends a spec to the specifying queue. Only valid in DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW states within the specifying phase.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--name` | yes | Display name for the spec |
| `--domain` | at DONE only | Domain this spec belongs to. Inferred from current domain at DRAFT and CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW. Required at DONE (no current domain). Optional override at other states. |
| `--topic` | yes | One-sentence topic of concern |
| `--file` | yes | Target spec file path (relative to project root) |
| `--source` | no | Planning source path (repeatable for multiple sources) |

#### `set-roots` — Set code search roots for a domain

Stores code search roots for use during the planning phase. Only valid in CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW or DONE states within the specifying phase.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--domain` | at DONE only | Domain to set roots for. Inferred from current domain at CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW. Required at DONE (no current domain). |
| (positional) | yes | One or more directory paths |

         Assign each sub-agent a subset of specs to review against the others.
         Fix any findings.
         After completion of the above, advance to begin evaluation.
```

**Entering CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL** (after CROSS_REFERENCE):

```
State:   CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL

         After completion of the above, advance with --verdict PASS|FAIL --eval-report <path>
```

**Entering CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW** (after first CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL):

CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW always fires once per domain after the first passing cross-reference eval. The action output varies based on `user_review`:

When `user_review: true`:

```

Phase:   specifying
Domain:  optimizer
Path:    optimizer/
Round:   1/2
Verdict: PASS
Eval:    optimizer/specs/.eval/cross-reference-r1.md

Action:  STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing.
         If additional specs are needed for this domain,
         write the new spec file, then register it:
           forgectl add-queue-item --name <name> --topic <topic> --file <file> [--source <path>...]
         Set code search roots for this domain (used in planning phase):
           forgectl set-roots <path> [<path>...]
         After completion of the above, advance to continue.
```

When `user_review: false`:

```
State:   CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW
Phase:   specifying
Domain:  optimizer
Path:    optimizer/
Round:   1/2
Verdict: PASS
Eval:    optimizer/specs/.eval/cross-reference-r1.md

Action:  Domain cross-reference complete.
         If additional specs are needed for this domain,
         write the new spec file, then register it:
           forgectl add-queue-item --name <name> --topic <topic> --file <file> [--source <path>...]
         Set code search roots for this domain (used in planning phase):
           forgectl set-roots <path> [<path>...]
         After completion of the above, advance to continue.
```

**Entering DONE** (after last domain's cross-reference complete, queue empty):

```
State:   DONE
Phase:   specifying
Specs:   5 completed
Action:  All individual specs complete.
         If additional specs are needed,
         write the new spec file, then register it:
           forgectl add-queue-item --name <name> --domain <domain> --topic <topic> --file <file> [--source <path>...]
           Adding specs here re-enters ORIENT for the new items before reconciliation.
         Set code search roots for any domain not yet configured (used in planning phase):
           forgectl set-roots --domain <domain> <path> [<path>...]
         When ready, advance to begin reconciliation.
```

#### Eval Report Locations

Specifying eval reports follow this convention:
```
<domain>/specs/.eval/batch-N-rM.md
```

Cross-reference eval reports:
```
<domain>/specs/.eval/cross-reference-rN.md
```

#### `status` output — Specifying (compact)

The compact `status` output for specifying shows the current batch, round, action, and a one-line progress summary:

```
Batch:   Repository Loading, Snapshot Diffing, Cache Invalidation (optimizer)
Round:   1/3

Action:  Read the eval report and address any findings in the spec files
         using the spec skill.
         Eval report: optimizer/specs/.eval/batch-1-r1.md
         Format:      references/spec-format.md
         Process:     references/spec-generation-skill.md
         Scoping:     references/topic-of-concern.md
         After completion of the above, advance to continue evaluation.

Progress: 1/5 specs completed, 2 queued
```

#### `status --verbose` output — Specifying section

With `--verbose`, the full queue, completed list with eval history, and prior phase summaries are appended:

```
--- Queue ---

  [4] Portal Rendering (portal)
  [5] Portal Caching (portal)

--- Completed ---

  [1] Configuration Models (optimizer)  — 2 rounds
       Round 1: FAIL — optimizer/specs/.eval/configuration-models-r1.md
       Round 2: PASS — optimizer/specs/.eval/configuration-models-r2.md
```

## Behavior

### Batch Selection

At ORIENT, the scaffold selects up to `specifying.batch` specs from the front of the queue, all from the same domain. Specs are pulled in queue order. Domain boundaries are batch boundaries — the batch ends when the domain changes or the batch size is reached.

### Domain Path

Each spec in the queue includes a `domain_path` — the filesystem path to the domain directory (e.g., `optimizer/`). The scaffold uses this to:
- Display shorter spec file paths (relative to `<domain_path>/specs/`)
- Discover all `.md` files in `<domain_path>/specs/` for cross-referencing
- The state file stores spec filenames only (e.g., `repository-loading.md`), not full paths. Full paths are reconstructed as `<domain_path>/specs/<filename>`.

### State Machine

             otherwise next domain or DONE
```

### Transition Table

| From State | Condition | To State | Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| ORIENT | always | SELECT | Pull next batch from queue into `current_specs`. Batch grouped by domain, up to `specifying.batch`. |
| SELECT | always | DRAFT | — |
| DRAFT | always | EVALUATE | Set round to 1. |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS`, round >= `specifying.eval.min_rounds` | ACCEPT | Record eval. TODO: Auto-commit with `--message` when `enable_commits: true` (not yet implemented). |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS`, round < `specifying.eval.min_rounds` | REFINE | Record eval (PASS + eval report). Min rounds not met. |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict FAIL`, round < `specifying.eval.max_rounds` | REFINE | Record eval (FAIL + eval report). |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict FAIL`, round >= `specifying.eval.max_rounds` | ACCEPT | Record eval (FAIL + eval report). Forced acceptance. |
| REFINE | always | EVALUATE | Increment round. |
| ACCEPT | domain has more batches in queue | ORIENT | Move batch specs to completed (with eval history + commit hashes). |
| ACCEPT | domain complete, queue non-empty | CROSS_REFERENCE | Move batch specs to completed. Begin domain cross-referencing. |
| ACCEPT | domain complete, queue empty | CROSS_REFERENCE | Move batch specs to completed. Begin domain cross-referencing. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE | always | CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | Set cross-reference round to 1 (first entry) or increment round. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round >= `specifying.cross_reference.min_rounds`, round == 1 | CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW | Record eval. Always enters CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW on first passing eval (regardless of `user_review`). |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round >= `specifying.cross_reference.min_rounds`, round > 1 | ORIENT or DONE | Record eval. If queue non-empty: ORIENT. Else: DONE. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict PASS`, round < `specifying.cross_reference.min_rounds` | CROSS_REFERENCE | Record eval. Min rounds not met. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict FAIL`, round < `specifying.cross_reference.max_rounds` | CROSS_REFERENCE | Record eval. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL | `--verdict FAIL`, round >= `specifying.cross_reference.max_rounds` | ORIENT or DONE | Record eval. Forced acceptance. If queue non-empty: ORIENT. Else: DONE. |
| CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW | always | ORIENT or DONE | If queue non-empty: ORIENT. Else: DONE. |
| DONE | queue non-empty (via add-queue-item) | ORIENT | Pull next batch from queue. Re-enters drafting loop. |
| DONE | queue empty | RECONCILE | Begin cross-domain reconciliation (see spec-reconciliation). |

### Eval Output Convention

The specifying evaluation sub-agent writes structured markdown to a known directory:

```
<domain>/specs/.eval/
├── batch-1-r1.md
├── batch-1-r2.md
├── cross-reference-r1.md
├── cross-reference-r2.md
└── ...
```

The scaffold does not read or write these files. This is a convention for the architect and sub-agent. The eval sub-agent evaluates all specs in the batch together in a single report.

### Add Queue Item

`forgectl add-queue-item` appends a spec to the end of the specifying queue. It does not affect the current batch.

1. Validate the current phase is `specifying`.
2. Validate the current state is DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW.
3. Validate all required flags: `--name`, `--topic`, `--file`.
4. Validate `--file` points to an existing file. If not: error with message instructing the architect to create the file first.
5. Resolve domain: if `--domain` is provided, use it. Otherwise, infer from the current domain (current batch domain at DRAFT, cross-reference domain at CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW). At DONE, `--domain` is required (no current domain).
6. Derive `domain_path` from the `--file` path (the directory two levels up from the file, e.g., `optimizer/specs/cache-eviction.md` → `optimizer/`). If the domain already exists in completed specs or queue, verify the derived `domain_path` matches.
7. Validate `--name` is unique across both the queue and completed specs.
8. Append the new entry to the end of `specifying.queue`.
9. Write the state file.
10. Print confirmation: spec name, domain, domain_path, and queue position.

When `add-queue-item` is used at DONE and the queue was previously empty, advancing from DONE re-enters ORIENT for the new items. After those items complete (including their domain's cross-reference), the scaffold returns to DONE. Reconciliation does not begin until the queue is empty again.

### Set Roots

`forgectl set-roots` stores code search roots for a domain. These roots are used during plan-queue generation at the specifying→planning phase shift.

1. Validate the current phase is `specifying`.
2. Validate the current state is CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW or DONE.
3. Resolve domain: if `--domain` is provided, use it. Otherwise, infer from the current cross-reference domain at CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW. At DONE, `--domain` is required (no current domain).
4. Validate the resolved domain has completed specs.
5. Validate at least one positional path argument is provided.
6. Store the roots in `specifying.domains[<domain>].code_search_roots`.
7. Write the state file.
8. Print confirmation: domain and roots.

Calling `set-roots` for a domain that already has roots overwrites the previous value.

---

## Invariants

1. **Batch is domain-homogeneous.** All specs in a batch share the same domain.
2. **Round monotonicity.** The specifying round counter only increments.
3. **Queue order preserved.** Specs are pulled from the front of the queue.
4. **Min rounds enforced.** PASS below `specifying.eval.min_rounds` forces another cycle.
5. **Max rounds enforced.** FAIL at `specifying.eval.max_rounds` forces acceptance.
6. **Guided pauses.** When `config.general.user_guided` is true, SELECT output includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing."
7. **Commit gating.** `--message` is only required when `enable_commits` is `true`.
8. **Domain cross-reference required.** Every domain passes through CROSS_REFERENCE before the next domain begins or DONE is reached.
9. **Cross-reference scans all domain specs.** CROSS_REFERENCE discovers all `.md` files in `<domain_path>/specs/`, not just session specs.
10. **Domain checkpoint fires once.** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW is entered exactly once per domain (after the first passing CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL), regardless of `user_review` setting.
11. **user_review controls output, not state entry.** When `user_review` is true, the CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW action includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing." When false, it says "Domain cross-reference complete." The state is entered either way.
12. **add-queue-item is state-gated.** Only valid in DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW within the specifying phase.
13. **set-roots is state-gated.** Only valid in CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW or DONE within the specifying phase.
14. **add-queue-item names are unique.** No duplicate names across queue and completed specs.
15. **DONE re-enters ORIENT when queue is non-empty.** If `add-queue-item` populates the queue at DONE, advancing re-enters ORIENT instead of RECONCILE.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round < `specifying.eval.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** REFINE.
  - **Rationale:** More evaluation rounds remain; the architect gets another chance to address deficiencies.

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict FAIL` when round >= `specifying.eval.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** ACCEPT (forced).
  - **Rationale:** The maximum rounds are exhausted. The batch is accepted as-is to prevent indefinite loops.

- **Scenario:** `advance --verdict PASS` when round < `specifying.eval.min_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** REFINE (min rounds not met).
  - **Rationale:** Even with a passing verdict, minimum evaluation rounds must be completed to ensure sufficient review.

- **Scenario:** Domain has fewer specs remaining than `specifying.batch`.
  - **Expected:** Batch contains all remaining specs for that domain.
  - **Rationale:** Batches are capped at `specifying.batch` but may be smaller. No padding occurs.

- **Scenario:** `enable_commits` is `false` and architect provides `--message` at EVALUATE PASS.
  - **Expected:** `--message` is ignored. No error.
  - **Rationale:** The flag is optional when commits are disabled.

- **Scenario:** Domain has no existing specs outside the queue (all specs are new).
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE lists only session specs under `[session — completed]`. `[existing — not in queue]` section is empty or omitted.
  - **Rationale:** Cross-referencing still runs to verify consistency among the new specs.

- **Scenario:** CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL FAIL at `specifying.cross_reference.max_rounds`.
  - **Expected:** Forced acceptance. Advance to next domain (ORIENT) or DONE.
  - **Rationale:** Maximum cross-reference rounds exhausted. Prevents indefinite loops.

- **Scenario:** First CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL passes, `user_review` is true.
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW with "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing." in action output.
  - **Rationale:** Domain checkpoint always fires. `user_review` adds the review prompt.

- **Scenario:** First CROSS_REFERENCE_EVAL passes, `user_review` is false.
  - **Expected:** CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW with "Domain cross-reference complete." in action output. No user review prompt.
  - **Rationale:** Domain checkpoint always fires for set-roots and add-queue-item collection. `user_review` only controls the review prompt.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called during EVALUATE.
  - **Expected:** Error: "add-queue-item is only valid in DRAFT, CROSS_REFERENCE_REVIEW, DONE, or RECONCILE_REVIEW states (current state: EVALUATE)." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Queue modifications are restricted to states where the architect is the actor with sufficient context.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with a name that already exists in the queue.
  - **Expected:** Error: "spec name '<name>' already exists in queue." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Duplicate names create ambiguity in status output, depends_on references, and completed specs tracking.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called at DONE when queue is empty, then advance.
  - **Expected:** Advance re-enters ORIENT. The new spec is pulled into a batch. After acceptance and cross-reference, returns to DONE.
  - **Rationale:** DONE only advances to RECONCILE when the queue is empty. Adding items re-opens the drafting loop.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` called during DRAFT for a different domain than the current batch.
  - **Expected:** Item appended to queue. Current batch continues unaffected. The new item is processed when its domain comes up in queue order.
  - **Rationale:** Queue append does not disturb the current batch.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with `--file` pointing to a file that does not exist.
  - **Expected:** Error: "file <path> does not exist. add-queue-item registers specs that have already been written. Create the spec file first, then register it." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** `add-queue-item` is for registering existing work, not queuing future work. The architect must write the spec before registering it.

- **Scenario:** `add-queue-item` with `--file` whose derived `domain_path` conflicts with an existing domain's path.
  - **Expected:** Error naming the conflict. Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Prevents silent domain_path mismatches that would break cross-referencing and file discovery.

- **Scenario:** `set-roots` called for a domain with no completed specs.
  - **Expected:** Error: "domain '<domain>' has no completed specs." Exit code 1.
  - **Rationale:** Roots are collected for domains that have been specified. Setting roots for an unknown domain is likely a typo.

- **Scenario:** `set-roots` called twice for the same domain.
  - **Expected:** Second call overwrites the first. No error.
  - **Rationale:** The architect may refine their understanding of code locations.

- **Scenario:** Phase shift to planning with no `set-roots` called for a domain.
  - **Expected:** `code_search_roots` defaults to `["<domain>/"]` in the generated plan-queue entry.
  - **Rationale:** The domain directory itself is the most common search root. Explicit roots override the default.

## Testing Criteria

### Study and draft advance sequentially
- **Verifies:** Sequential state progression through specifying states.
- **Given:** ORIENT.
- **When:** advance through SELECT → DRAFT → EVALUATE.
- **Then:** Each transitions in order.

### ORIENT selects batch by domain
- **Verifies:** Batch selection groups by domain up to specifying.batch.
