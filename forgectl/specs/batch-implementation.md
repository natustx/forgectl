# Batch Implementation

## Topic of Concern
> The scaffold implements plan items in dependency-ordered batches through iterative evaluation.

## Context

The implementing phase delivers plan items one at a time within dependency-ordered batches. After each batch is fully implemented, an evaluation sub-agent verifies against acceptance criteria through iterative rounds. Items progress through `pending` → `done` → `passed`/`failed` states tracked in plan.json.

Layers enforce a coarse ordering (all layer N items must be terminal before layer N+1), while `depends_on` within a layer provides fine-grained ordering. Batches are groups of up to `implementing.batch` unblocked items drawn from the current layer.

## Depends On
- **phase-transitions** — the planning→implementing phase shift validates plan.json, adds tracking fields, and triggers ORIENT.
- **session-init** — alternatively, `init --phase implementing` starts the implementing phase directly.
- **state-persistence** — reads and writes the state file.

## Integration Points

| Spec | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| plan.json | Planning produces it; implementing consumes and mutates it (adding `passes` and `rounds` fields) |
| Implementation evaluator prompt (`evaluators/impl-eval.md`, embedded in binary) | Full instructions for the implementation evaluation sub-agent: what to check, report format, verdict rules |
| phase-transitions | DONE → PHASE_SHIFT when plans remain (implementing → planning when `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, implementing → implementing when `true`) |

## Interface

### Inputs

#### `advance` flags — Implementing Phase

| State | Flags |
|-------|-------|
| IMPLEMENT | `--message <text>` (required first round only, when `enable_commits: true`) |
| EVALUATE | `--verdict PASS\|FAIL` (required), `--eval-report <path>` (required when `enable_eval_output: true`) |
| COMMIT | `--message <text>` (required when `enable_commits: true`) |

#### `eval` command

| Command | Flags | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `eval` | none | Output full evaluation context for the sub-agent. Only valid in implementing EVALUATE. |

### Rejection

| Condition | Signal | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `advance` in implementing IMPLEMENT (first round) without `--message` when `enable_commits: true` | Error. Exit code 1. | First-round items need a commit message when commits are enabled |
| `advance` in implementing COMMIT without `--message` when `enable_commits: true` | Error. Exit code 1. | Batch completion needs a commit message when commits are enabled |
| `advance` in implementing EVALUATE without `--verdict` | Error. Exit code 1. | Verdict determines the transition |
| `advance` in implementing EVALUATE without `--eval-report` when `enable_eval_output: true` | Error. Exit code 1. | Every evaluation must reference its report when eval output is enabled |
| `advance --eval-report` pointing to non-existent file | Error naming the path. Exit code 1. | Report must exist to be recorded |
| `advance --eval-report` when `enable_eval_output: false` | Warning: `--eval-report is ignored, eval output is not enabled`. Command proceeds. | Consistent with `--message` warning pattern |
| `eval` outside of implementing EVALUATE | Error naming current state and phase. Exit code 1. | Eval context only available in EVALUATE |

---

## Behavior

### Batch Calculation

Batches are groups of items drawn from the current layer. The scaffold selects up to `implementing.batch` unblocked items.

An item is **unblocked** when:
1. All items in prior layers have a terminal `passes` value (`passed` or `failed`)
2. All items in its `depends_on` list have a terminal `passes` value

Items are selected in the order they appear in the layer's `items` array.

### State Machine

```
ORIENT → IMPLEMENT(1) → IMPLEMENT(2) → ... → EVALUATE
                                                  │

                              ORIENT/DONE ◄──────────────────────┘
                                                FAIL + rounds
                                                >= max_rounds

                                                   COMMIT → ORIENT/DONE
```

### Transition Table

| From State | Condition | To State | Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| ORIENT | unblocked items exist in current layer | IMPLEMENT | Select batch. Present first item. |
| ORIENT | all layer items terminal, more layers | ORIENT (next layer) | Advance `current_layer`. |
| ORIENT | all layers complete | DONE | — |
| IMPLEMENT | more items in batch | IMPLEMENT | Mark current item `done`. Present next item. |
| IMPLEMENT | last item in batch | EVALUATE | Mark current item `done`. Increment `rounds` on all batch items. |
| EVALUATE | PASS, rounds >= `implementing.eval.min_rounds` | COMMIT | Mark items `passed`. Record eval. |
| EVALUATE | PASS, rounds < `implementing.eval.min_rounds` | IMPLEMENT | Record eval. Re-present first item with eval file. |
| EVALUATE | FAIL, rounds < `implementing.eval.max_rounds` | IMPLEMENT | Record eval. Re-present first item with eval file. |
| EVALUATE | FAIL, rounds >= `implementing.eval.max_rounds` | COMMIT | Mark items `failed`. Record eval. Force-accept. |
| COMMIT | more batches or layers | ORIENT | — |
| COMMIT | all layers complete | DONE | — |
| DONE | `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, planning queue non-empty | PHASE_SHIFT | PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → planning). Return to planning for next domain. |
| DONE | `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, implementing plan queue non-empty | PHASE_SHIFT | PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → implementing, domain boundary). Pull next plan. |
| DONE | no plans remaining | _(terminal)_ | Session complete. |

### Item `passes` Transitions

| Event | `passes` change |
|-------|----------------|
| Engineer advances past item in IMPLEMENT | `pending` → `done` |
| EVALUATE PASS + rounds >= min_rounds | `done` → `passed` |
| EVALUATE FAIL + rounds >= max_rounds | `done` → `failed` |
| EVALUATE FAIL + rounds < max_rounds | stays `done` |
| EVALUATE PASS + rounds < min_rounds | stays `done` |

### IMPLEMENT Behavior

Presents **one item at a time**. Displays full context: name, description, steps, files, specs, refs, test summary.

**First round (no prior eval):** Action says "Implement this item." Advance requires `--message` — the scaffold commits after each item.

**Subsequent rounds (after eval):** When `enable_eval_output: true`, action says "Study the eval file and implement any corrections." When `enable_eval_output: false`, action says "Make corrections based off communication with the evaluator." No `--message` required — corrections are committed at the COMMIT state after the batch passes.

### EVALUATE Behavior

Two actors:

**Sub-agent** runs `forgectl eval` to receive full item details, evaluator prompt, and (when `enable_eval_output: true`) report target path and previous eval history.

**Engineer** reviews the report (or sub-agent's verbal verdict when `enable_eval_output: false`), runs `forgectl advance --verdict PASS|FAIL` (with `--eval-report <path>` when `enable_eval_output: true`).

### COMMIT State

Hard stop after a batch reaches terminal evaluation. Ensures all implementation work is committed before proceeding.

Appears after:
- EVALUATE with PASS + sufficient rounds
- EVALUATE with FAIL at max_rounds (force-accept)

When `enable_commits` is `true`, the engineer runs `forgectl advance --message <commit msg>` to commit and proceed. When `false`, the engineer runs `forgectl advance` to proceed.

## Invariants

1. **Layer ordering enforced.** All items in layer N must be terminal before layer N+1.
2. **Dependency ordering enforced.** Items only delivered when `depends_on` items are terminal.
3. **Item order preserved.** Items delivered in layer's `items` array order.
4. **One item at a time.** IMPLEMENT presents a single item per advance.
5. **plan.json is the progress record.** `passes` and `rounds` reflect current state.
6. **COMMIT precedes progression.** Every batch boundary passes through COMMIT before ORIENT/DONE.
7. **First-round commits.** When `enable_commits` is `true`, IMPLEMENT advance requires `--message` and commits on the first round only. When `enable_commits` is `false`, `--message` is not required at IMPLEMENT or COMMIT.
8. **Two actors, two commands.** Engineer uses `advance`; sub-agent uses `eval`.
9. **Scaffold does not parse eval files.** Verdict provided via `--verdict`; when `enable_eval_output: true`, file path stored as reference. When `false`, no file path is stored.
10. **Min rounds enforced.** PASS below `implementing.eval.min_rounds` forces another implementation cycle.
11. **Max rounds enforced.** FAIL at `implementing.eval.max_rounds` forces acceptance.
12. **Guided pauses.** When `config.general.user_guided` is true, ORIENT output includes "STOP please review and discuss with user before continuing."
13. **Auto-commit at commit points.** When `enable_commits` is `true`, `--message` is required at IMPLEMENT (first round) and COMMIT states. The scaffold stages files per `implementing.commit_strategy` (default: `scoped`) and runs `git commit -m <message>`. When `enable_commits` is `false`, `--message` is not shown in output; if provided, a warning is printed: `--message is ignored, commits are not enabled`. The warning does not instruct how to enable commits. See `docs/auto-committing.md`.

## Edge Cases

- **Scenario:** Layer has fewer items than `implementing.batch`.
  - **Expected:** Single batch contains all items.
  - **Rationale:** Batches are capped at `implementing.batch` but may be smaller. No padding or splitting occurs.

- **Scenario:** Batch has one item.
  - **Expected:** IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE directly.
  - **Rationale:** Single-item batches skip the multi-item advance loop; the item is marked `done` and evaluation begins.

- **Scenario:** EVALUATE PASS but rounds < min_rounds.
  - **Expected:** Re-enter IMPLEMENT. No commit reminder (not first round).
  - **Rationale:** Minimum evaluation rounds must be met regardless of verdict. The engineer gets another pass through the items.

- **Scenario:** EVALUATE FAIL at max_rounds.
  - **Expected:** Items `failed`. COMMIT. ORIENT.
  - **Rationale:** The maximum rounds are exhausted. Items are force-accepted as failed to prevent indefinite loops.

- **Scenario:** Item depends on a `failed` item.
  - **Expected:** Still unblocked — `failed` is terminal.
  - **Rationale:** `failed` is a terminal state just like `passed`. Dependent items proceed regardless of whether dependencies passed or failed.

- **Scenario:** All layers complete, no plans remaining.
  - **Expected:** COMMIT → DONE. Session complete.
  - **Rationale:** DONE with no remaining plans is the terminal state.

- **Scenario:** All layers complete, `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, planning queue has plans remaining.
  - **Expected:** COMMIT → DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → planning).
  - **Rationale:** Interleaved mode returns to planning for the next domain.

- **Scenario:** All layers complete, `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, implementing plan queue has plans remaining.
  - **Expected:** COMMIT → DONE → PHASE_SHIFT (implementing → implementing, next domain).
  - **Rationale:** All-planning-first mode continues implementing the next domain's plan.

- **Scenario:** `eval` called outside EVALUATE.
  - **Expected:** Error.
  - **Rationale:** Evaluation context is only meaningful in EVALUATE state; the sub-agent has nothing to evaluate otherwise.

## Testing Criteria

### ORIENT selects first batch
- **Verifies:** Batch selection from layer items.
- **Given:** ORIENT (implementing), L0 has 4 items, `implementing.batch: 2`.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is IMPLEMENT. First item presented.

### IMPLEMENT presents items one at a time
- **Verifies:** Single-item presentation with batch progression.
- **Given:** IMPLEMENT, batch has 2 items, on item 1.
- **When:** `advance --message "Implement config types"`
- **Then:** Item 1 `done`. Item 2 presented.

### IMPLEMENT last item → EVALUATE
- **Verifies:** Last item triggers evaluation.
- **Given:** IMPLEMENT, last item in batch.
- **When:** `advance --message "Implement config load"`
- **Then:** Item `done`. Rounds incremented. State is EVALUATE.

### First-round IMPLEMENT requires --message when enable_commits is true
- **Verifies:** Commit message required on first round when commits enabled.
- **Given:** IMPLEMENT, first round (no prior eval), `enable_commits: true`.
- **When:** `advance` without `--message`
- **Then:** Exit code 1.

### First-round IMPLEMENT without --message when enable_commits is false
- **Verifies:** No commit message required when commits disabled.
- **Given:** IMPLEMENT, first round (no prior eval), `enable_commits: false`.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** Advances. No error.

### Subsequent-round IMPLEMENT does not require --message
- **Verifies:** No commit on subsequent rounds.
- **Given:** IMPLEMENT, entered after EVALUATE (round 2+).
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** Advances without committing. No error.

### EVALUATE PASS with sufficient rounds → COMMIT
- **Verifies:** PASS with sufficient rounds marks items passed.
- **Given:** EVALUATE, rounds >= `implementing.eval.min_rounds`.
- **When:** `advance --eval-report ... --verdict PASS`
- **Then:** Items `passed`. State is COMMIT.

### EVALUATE FAIL at max_rounds → COMMIT
- **Verifies:** FAIL at max rounds marks items failed.
- **Given:** EVALUATE, rounds == `implementing.eval.max_rounds`.
- **When:** `advance --eval-report ... --verdict FAIL`
- **Then:** Items `failed`. State is COMMIT.

### EVALUATE FAIL within max_rounds → IMPLEMENT
- **Verifies:** FAIL within max rounds triggers re-implementation.
- **Given:** EVALUATE, rounds < `implementing.eval.max_rounds`.
- **When:** `advance --eval-report ... --verdict FAIL`
- **Then:** State is IMPLEMENT. First item with eval file.

### COMMIT → ORIENT (more items)
- **Verifies:** Batch completion returns to ORIENT for next batch.
- **Given:** COMMIT, more items in layer.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is ORIENT.

### COMMIT → DONE (all complete)
- **Verifies:** Final batch completion reaches terminal state.
- **Given:** COMMIT, all layers complete.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** State is DONE.

### Implementing eval command outputs item details
- **Verifies:** Eval command assembles full evaluation context.
- **Given:** EVALUATE (implementing), batch has 2 items, `enable_eval_output: true`.
- **When:** `forgectl eval`
- **Then:** Output includes impl-eval.md contents, item details, report target path.

### Implementing eval command omits report target when eval output disabled
- **Verifies:** No report path when eval output disabled.
- **Given:** EVALUATE (implementing), batch has 2 items, `enable_eval_output: false`.
- **When:** `forgectl eval`
- **Then:** Output includes impl-eval.md contents, item details. No report target path.

### Failed items don't block dependents
- **Verifies:** Failed items are terminal for dependency resolution.
- **Given:** Item A `failed`, item B depends on A.
- **Then:** B is unblocked.

### DONE with no plans remaining is terminal
- **Verifies:** Terminal state when all plans implemented.
- **Given:** DONE, no plans remaining (neither planning queue nor implementing plan queue).
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** Error: "session complete."

### DONE transitions to planning when interleaved
- **Verifies:** DONE returns to planning in interleaved mode.
- **Given:** DONE, `plan_all_before_implementing: false`, planning queue has 1 plan.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** PHASE_SHIFT entered. After advancing: `phase: "planning"`, `state: "ORIENT"`.

### DONE transitions to next domain when all-planning-first
- **Verifies:** DONE continues implementing next domain.
- **Given:** DONE, `plan_all_before_implementing: true`, implementing plan queue has 1 plan.
- **When:** `advance`
- **Then:** PHASE_SHIFT entered. After advancing: `state: "ORIENT"`. Next plan loaded.

## Implements
- Implementing phase: layer-ordered batched item delivery with one-at-a-time presentation
- Batch size controlled by `implementing.batch`
- Eval round enforcement (`implementing.eval.min_rounds`/`max_rounds`) with forced acceptance
- COMMIT state for batch boundary pauses
- Commit gating via `enable_commits` configuration
- Domain artifacts in `.forge_workspace/`
- Dual evaluator prompts: impl-eval.md for implementation sub-agent
